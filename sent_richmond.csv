Between scrapping their VFLW team in COVID, to then axing the partnership with Port Melbourne VFLW this year, no real communication about the Sheerin trade, Yassir wanting out - and then not announcing Ferguson's resigning on their website, socials or in our email comms to members, instead just letting it quietly be announced by AFLW hoping it goes under the rug. All of it combined over recent years just leaves a bit of a bad feeling on the overall management

Collingwood (Pies) have a huge fanbase, the second largest to the Swans, so you'll have company that's for sure. They're the popular ones.

Collingwood are considered a good team, they're recent grand final winners and they're into the semi finals this year, so you shouldn't have to worry about them being knocked out of the ladder too early (at least for now).

Collingwood are based in Melbourne, so if you're not Melbourne based or you're in another state, you might not have as many opportunities to watch them play on home soil, or you might not have as many local comrades if you're backing Collingwood over your local team - take it from me a Pies supporter in Sydney 😂

Collingwood have a reputation for inconsistent and nail-biter games. My friends and I joke that Collingwood will enter the final quarter 40 points ahead and somehow manage to just squeak by. They love to be super far behind and make huge comebacks, or be leading by a mile and fumble it. They're not for the faint of heart! (Swans also have a reputation of dominating the ladder then fumbling it at the very end).

Collingwood are direct rivals with Carlton and Richmond, so if you for some reason enjoy those two teams or live in those suburbs, Collingwood might not be the team for you. I've gotten mean looks walking around Carlton with a Collingwood gersey on.

Collingwood's star player is Bobby Hill, if there's something about Bobby Hill you don't like you'll struggle to fit in because he is God to Collingwood fans.

And lastly, as I mentioned, Collingwood have a huge fanbase, so if you're looking to root for the underdog or a smaller team, then they wouldn't be for you.

If you’d told me in 2001 that Geelong and Sydney would be two of the dominant teams of the next 20 years and that Essendon and North Melbourne would be two of the worst performed teams I’d have laughed you out of the room. 

But the Bombers and the Roos in particular have been victims of poor draft choices, poor management, poor decisions off-field. The AFL can only do so much. 

A team like the Tigers are great example of different management strategies. They’ve finished on top once on this period, only played five prelims, but won three flags - one fewer than the Cats, Lions and Hawks but one more than the Magpies. And now they’re on the way down again. 

The Lions? They were a laughing stock less than a decade ago. The Hawks? They haven’t won a flag in a decade. 

And there’s teams like the Power who should have won a flag with a little more luck. The Blues and the Demons, who are a mix of unlucky and poor management. 

I just think it’s a very simple way to look at things to say that equalisation doesn’t work.",0.9807,pos

Ask any Tigers fan what constitutes success for this season; beating Carlton in Round 1 made their season arguably, plus a few other wins when they weren't expected to get any. 

On the other hand, if its a perennial club that is contending or expected to have success over a long period, or been close enough to ultimate glory (call it what you will) that a GF loss would, on paper, make it appear that they'll easily back in the similar position in 12 months, when mentally, as the results have shown, its tougher to get there, just to even win a final. 

It arguably easier to win multiple premierships in a row than it is to lose a Grand Final with a huge margin and be back there the following season. 

What makes the 2024 loss sting worse for the Swans in my opinion was that they got badly beaten in 2022, (a team ahead of its time some can say - leading to 2023 down year), make it back in 2024 and not go close to winning it again, when they should have been much improved and more mentally prepared. Its both the coaching staff, and the players on the park. The Swans in 2025 would have been okay if they lost 2024 by a couple of goals (again debatable).

There is simply no one that even comes close to the level of insight he has into the game. I’ve lost count of how many times he has completely called exactly what pans out in the next passages of play. He is simply exceptional at it.
  
He also got so mad calling a Richmond game last year that he was silent for a quarter.  
  
But on the flip side, he has the absolute worst takes on any sort of social issue in the game. Flat out doesn’t believe slurs of any sort should warrant suspensions.",-0.8627,neg

Culture isn't just from the top it is brought by the personalities in the team. I think this is often overlooked because skill and talent alone isn't enough but you need to pair it with the correct attitudes in the whole team.
 I'm very happy for gold coast because we all thought it was a basket case when co captains steven may and tom lynch left.

ncqgxkg,1n9ztzz,2025-09-06T14:12:58+00:00,Teimy,2,"Personally I do not rate him, Unbelievable tagger, but the games moving past that need.

Hes good and obviously deserves an AFL gig but 600k a year sounded about right for him to me which is apparently what he was being offered. (Wanted 800k) 

I think ideally you want a guy like Dunkley who can tag when necessary, but most teams these days just go pound for pound, gun mid vs gun mid. 

Not really worth paying decent coin for someone who is a specialist tagger (unlucky for him because he was told to develop into that role for the past few years) And when he was given the reigns to get some pill himself he would get 30+ disposals for us, but we barely beat Richmond and Essendon in those games. That tells me he isnt creative enough when he gets the ball that much (or impactful) and probably abit of a stat padder in the handball chain. 

I really like him, seems like a good guy. But he’s kind of over rated by Saints fans. I know full well i’d cop alot of flack for this among other fans, but I truly believe this, this is just my opinion though. 

Good luck to him, get the bag",0.9889,pos

Danger had a knack to make the wrong decisions or just be poor by foot for a game every now and then, and Dusty had the ability to kind of go into cruise control in that Richmond side and let the others do the work around him.

The giants just lost after a crazy comeback, lost their best young player midway through the game who would have been massive in the endgame and he’s now gone probably for all of 2026, and also lost their most dependable backman in the final quarter. I think we’re allowed to be a bit disappointed.

And the umpiring was fucked. It’s been fucked all season across the entire AFL and everyone knows it. And the giants had the worst free kick differential in the comp in this year that everyone says was fucked expect for Essendon who are irrelevant. The giants are the only team that is simultaneously in the bottom 5 for free kicks for and in the top 5 for free kicks against.

In the years the giants have looked their absolute best (and 2019 was not one of these) the umpiring has been between bad and atrocious in the finals they’ve lost including the 2016 prelim which was far worse than the 2016 grand final, and in 2023 where they got royally fucked. 

The only team over the last entire 10 years that has a worse free kick differential than the giants is Richmond and they have three fucking premierships so who cares. Happy to share with you the stats. 

Absolutely no one in the comp has the right that the giants have to be furious at the umpiring, and this year’s umpiring has been the worst in many seasons.",-0.9892,neg
