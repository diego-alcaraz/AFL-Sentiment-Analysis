Let's look at her track record.

Got investigated by the Australian Press Council after claiming Hird was sacked, changing the article like 4 times to suggest it was coming shortly, only for Hird to remain as Essendon's coach for 10 months after the article was released.

Claimed that Hird wanted to return to Essendon, which was denied by Hird the day after, almost immediately. (this was just last year).

She said Clarkson was going to coach Essendon. He's not. He's coaching North.

**1996 PF**: 2nd North Melb 17.12 (114) def 3rd Brisbane 11.10 (76)

So, that's two wins and two losses for the Bears if you want to treat them as a distinct club.

This makes it sound like he's unhappy playing on the wing but that's where Clarko wants him. It's a little frustrating for me also because he was a noticeably better player on the wing than in the mid. I'd like to see him there more. 


As for him being captain, supporters have made him a bit of a whipping boy partly because they don't think he's good enough on field to be captain. The fans don't choose the captain, the players do.

He’s actually the most annoying player. No skill but tries to kick into traffic. No strength but tries to break tackles and doo too much.

He’s a decent player, but they made him captain and he tried to do too much and often his mistakes outweighed the good. He had some fantastic games and moments, but that’s it.

Considering we drafted heavily for young mids, he’s not going to be in our best 22 as a midfielder, possibly by next year. Even this year he played as a forward and wing when he’s neither of those things.

He needs to go to a team that can use him and doesn’t have young guys like LDU, Wardlaw, Powell and Parker who are better at that inside mid role. Or a club that has them but they’re 30. 

I could see him going to Collingwood or St Kilda and replacing someone like Jack Crisp or Jack Steele eventually. Or basically any other team that needs a hard guy to go head first into a pack and extract a ball out to somebody with vision and skill.

nealpfk,1nhcfml,2025-09-15T04:33:25+00:00,BusinessPooh,2,"The advent of free agency has helped football’s stars get richer than their wildest dreams but as a player movement mechanism it has been an unmitigated disaster.  

Jordan Ridley, Charlie Curnow and Zach Merrett are attempting to escape their clubs but are instead trapped in long-term deals that have made them wealthy but desperately unhappy.  

The idea of free agency was worthy when introduced at the end of 2012 to give players unprecedented flexibility to move clubs — for success, money or a return to their home state.  

The execution of it has been a dog’s breakfast. 

Consider its legacy and the unintended consequences it has forced upon the AFL and its clubs.  

It has led to ridiculously long deals like Aaron Naughton’s eight-year extension forced upon clubs because of impending free agency that we might as well call the pre-agency tariff.  

The desperate club fears that their best players might hit free agency unsigned has given stars the ultimate leverage as pre-agents seven seasons into their careers.  

It has required clubs to match those insane deals fully aware they are dangerously exposed to a player’s career-ending concussion that the AFL will not allow them to exempt from their salary caps.  

It has seen clubs like West Coast forced into unenviable decisions to gently nudge their co-captain Oscar Allen out of the door for the free agency compensation bonanza that awaits.  

It has allowed delisted players to find their club of choice much more easily.  

But ask clubs like North Melbourne chasing delisted free agent Tyson Stengle in late 2021 what they think of it as a competitive balance measure given he joined powerhouse Geelong and won a premiership as a 2022 All-Australian.  

In the past 10 years of free agency the Roos have secured just Aidan Corr as a genuine free agent (as well as delisted free agents Toby Pink, Hugh Greenwood, Josh Walker and Alex Morgan) while this year alone premiers Brisbane will pick up Allen and Sam Draper.  

Geelong secured Stengle, Luke Dahlhaus, Patrick Dangerfield and Jeremy Cameron (although eventually forced into trades for the latter pair) and a veteran called Isaac Smith who took home the Norm Smith Medal.  

Its inflationary effect has allowed players like Jack Silvagni (with one top 10 best and fairest finish in his career) and Essendon’s Draper (who doesn’t have a top 12 b-and-f finish) to accept deals of over $4m this season.  

And it has led to the kind of six-year deals Charlie Curnow signed to give away his free agency rights, seeking security over any form of flexibility in the back-end of his career.  

Carlton will desperately attempt to hold Curnow to his deal (unless they get a better trade offer) arguing that he chose to sign that deal and can accept its long-term consequences.  

In Curnow’s defence it would have been negligent for him and his management not to sign a long-term deal given the concerns over his knee.  

But he is properly stuck — unless Gold Coast decides centre half forward Ethan Read getting badly beaten in successive finals is the trigger for them to fall in love with Curnow.  

The problem for Essendon stars Ridley and Merrett is that free agency gave both of them an incentive to sign away any flexibility even if they had concerns about their futures at the Hangar.  

Merrett might have jumped ship back in 2021 but instead Essendon’s only final berth in the past six years coincided with his season of free agency.  

By a fluke of timing he falsely thought Essendon might have a bright future.  

After some equivocation he re-signed with Essendon in June that year months ahead of that finals berth and given rival free agency offers he locked himself in for six years.  

Not a two-year deal to unrestricted free agency (and total control of his destiny) but a whopper with the lot through to 2027.  

He re-signed in June 2021, Essendon then squeaked into finals with an 11-11 win-loss record and was bashed up by the Dogs in another elimination finals demolition (49 points).  

The club hasn’t played finals since.  

Ironically, the Dons trumpeted his signing on their website as “Merrett a Bomber for Life”.  

Remarkably, Ridley has actually signed three contract extensions since October 2020.  

In 2020 after a Crichton Medal victory the key defender signed a four-year deal to free agency in 2024.  

Then only a year later in September 2021 he extended his deal by two seasons to 2026 after another bumper season.  

Then in February 2024 he signed on for a further three seasons to 2029, saying he was “proud to have the opportunity to play for such a great club for such a long time”.  

So Ridley willingly signed away his restricted free agency rights, then signed away his unrestricted free agency rights, but now wants out because Essendon is ordinary.

Perth set to host Australian-exclusive return of AFL Origin in 2026
Western Australian players to face off against Victorian counterparts
Iconic match expected to draw thousands of visitors to WA and inject millions into the visitor economy

Supported by the Cook Government through Tourism WA
Perth has scored another historic Australian-exclusive event, with AFL Origin to return after 26 years on Saturday,14 February 2026 at Optus Stadium.

Supported by the Cook Government through Tourism WA, the groundbreaking match will feature a top-tier team of WA AFL players, who will face off against their Victorian opponents.

The pre-season Valentine's Day match between WA and Victoria is expected to draw thousands of out-of-state visitors to WA.

Next year's match will also be the only AFL Origin fixture to take place in 2026 and the first interstate showdown since 1999, when South Australia and Victoria went head-to-head.

Originating in 1977, previous State of Origin matches proved hugely popular, with an attendance peak of over 91,000 fans at the MCG in 1989.

The 2026 AFL Origin game will be broadcast on Channel 7 and Fox, and streamed on 7Plus and Kayo, spotlighting Perth and its world-class sporting facilities to the rest of the nation.

AFL Origin is another example of the Cook Government's economic diversification strategy to attract a year-round events calendar to drive out-of-state visitation and generate valuable tourism dollars for local business and industry.

The match comes in addition to the two home games North Melbourne will play in Perth and Bunbury in 2026, as part of the Cook Government's growing partnership with the AFL.

Comments attributed to Premier Roger Cook:

""For the first time this century, Western Australian footy fans will be able to watch our State's best players don the black swan and take on the Victorians.

""It's a proud achievement for my government to bring to Perth a rivalry which started in the 1900s and was defined in the legendary matches of the 1980s.

""We know Western Australians love their footy and will fill Optus Stadium to see this blockbuster match, as will many interstate tourists.""

Comments attributed to Sport and Recreation Minister Rita Saffioti:

""This is a fantastic opportunity to see some of Western Australia's best talent on display at Optus Stadium and I know many West Australians will enjoy watching WA players at their best.""

""I enjoyed watching State of Origin in the 80s and 90s and I want a new generation to love the game like I did.

""Events like this will draw huge crowds from all over the State and country and help boost our economy while also inspiring the next generation of athletes.

""This match will also provide a boost to our local communities with money being funded back into grassroots football so our government can continue to ensure we have the best facilities and infrastructure for everyone to access.""

Comments attributed to Tourism Minister Reece Whitby:

""Perth is making history by securing the return of AFL Origin, which hasn't taken place in Australia since 1999.

""The Cook Government is committed to our economic diversification strategy - we're incredibly proud to secure such an exclusive match and we're confident it will have a positive impact on the State, drawing thousands of fans from across Australia, boosting our tourism and hospitality businesses, and injecting millions of dollars in visitor spend into our State's economy.

""Hosting an iconic match like this also boosts WA's reputation as a world-class host of sporting events, putting the State in a position to attract bigger and better events every year, and giving visitors a time-specific reason to visit the State and extend their stay.

""Origin footy has a long and storied history, so to all the Victorians and footy fans across the country, I urge you to travel west and witness this classic game.""",0.9987,pos

What it can and should do is stop clubs being able to *both* generate the points *and* kick the pick into the future. In 2023, Gold Coast had pick 4. They turned that into points for their academy players, Bulldogs' 2024 1st, and a North end of first round priority pick.

Obviously there are other factors - northern academies, fixture decisions, and the plethora of AFL decisions driven by what appears to be an overwhelming finance driven set of priorities.

If you’d told me in 2001 that Geelong and Sydney would be two of the dominant teams of the next 20 years and that Essendon and North Melbourne would be two of the worst performed teams I’d have laughed you out of the room. 

But the Bombers and the Roos in particular have been victims of poor draft choices, poor management, poor decisions off-field. The AFL can only do so much. 

A team like the Tigers are great example of different management strategies. They’ve finished on top once on this period, only played five prelims, but won three flags - one fewer than the Cats, Lions and Hawks but one more than the Magpies. And now they’re on the way down again. 

The Lions? They were a laughing stock less than a decade ago. The Hawks? They haven’t won a flag in a decade.

I think GC beat Lions. Lions are missing Neale and Hipwood. Two pretty critical pieces.


Crows Vs. Hawks. I don't have a Scooby Doo. 


Hawks were nearly top 4 until the final weekend. So way stronger than a typical 8th placed team. Hawks have also been a bogey side for the Crows and have more finals experience.


Crows finished minor premiers giving them the largest ever ladder jump (15 to 1). No previous finals experience. Michalanney will move back into defence (1 game since injury) and Rachele is back. Massive ins.


AFL media might have jynxed the crows. They have an article up about how the Hawks need to overcome 42 years of history to beat the Crows.


""The last team to finish on top of the ladder and lose two straight finals was North Melbourne way back in 1983.""


So Crows could make history again. But not in a good way.

I tried to find a game that would make sense. There was only one Football Game that would make sense and that was Essendon Reserves vs Murray Kangaroos in Rd 9, 2002. It was also the last game of that VFL season at Windy Hill. It was also the last game until 2013 that Essendon played as Essendon in the VFL. It was also the last game that North Melbourne's VFL team was known as the Kangaroos until 2018. There were no AFL preseason games at Windy Hill from 2002-2014. 

So in theory it could be from that Essendon vs Murray Kangaroos game and then put into storage before being dumped between 2009-2014. 

My other theory is that it was used by the Essendon Cricket Club until somewhere between 2009-2014, because there is a Greenvale Kangaroos in the same league as the Essendon Cricket Club. 

But I feel that my Murray Kangaroos game in 2002 might be the correct answer.",-0.7147,neg
