nealpfk,1nhcfml,2025-09-15T04:33:25+00:00,BusinessPooh,2,"The advent of free agency has helped football’s stars get richer than their wildest dreams but as a player movement mechanism it has been an unmitigated disaster.  

Jordan Ridley, Charlie Curnow and Zach Merrett are attempting to escape their clubs but are instead trapped in long-term deals that have made them wealthy but desperately unhappy.  

The idea of free agency was worthy when introduced at the end of 2012 to give players unprecedented flexibility to move clubs — for success, money or a return to their home state.  

The execution of it has been a dog’s breakfast. 

Consider its legacy and the unintended consequences it has forced upon the AFL and its clubs.  

It has led to ridiculously long deals like Aaron Naughton’s eight-year extension forced upon clubs because of impending free agency that we might as well call the pre-agency tariff.  

The desperate club fears that their best players might hit free agency unsigned has given stars the ultimate leverage as pre-agents seven seasons into their careers.  

It has required clubs to match those insane deals fully aware they are dangerously exposed to a player’s career-ending concussion that the AFL will not allow them to exempt from their salary caps.  

It has seen clubs like West Coast forced into unenviable decisions to gently nudge their co-captain Oscar Allen out of the door for the free agency compensation bonanza that awaits.  

It has allowed delisted players to find their club of choice much more easily.  

But ask clubs like North Melbourne chasing delisted free agent Tyson Stengle in late 2021 what they think of it as a competitive balance measure given he joined powerhouse Geelong and won a premiership as a 2022 All-Australian.  

In the past 10 years of free agency the Roos have secured just Aidan Corr as a genuine free agent (as well as delisted free agents Toby Pink, Hugh Greenwood, Josh Walker and Alex Morgan) while this year alone premiers Brisbane will pick up Allen and Sam Draper.  

Geelong secured Stengle, Luke Dahlhaus, Patrick Dangerfield and Jeremy Cameron (although eventually forced into trades for the latter pair) and a veteran called Isaac Smith who took home the Norm Smith Medal.  

Its inflationary effect has allowed players like Jack Silvagni (with one top 10 best and fairest finish in his career) and Essendon’s Draper (who doesn’t have a top 12 b-and-f finish) to accept deals of over $4m this season.  

And it has led to the kind of six-year deals Charlie Curnow signed to give away his free agency rights, seeking security over any form of flexibility in the back-end of his career.  

Carlton will desperately attempt to hold Curnow to his deal (unless they get a better trade offer) arguing that he chose to sign that deal and can accept its long-term consequences.  

In Curnow’s defence it would have been negligent for him and his management not to sign a long-term deal given the concerns over his knee.  

But he is properly stuck — unless Gold Coast decides centre half forward Ethan Read getting badly beaten in successive finals is the trigger for them to fall in love with Curnow.  

The problem for Essendon stars Ridley and Merrett is that free agency gave both of them an incentive to sign away any flexibility even if they had concerns about their futures at the Hangar.  

Merrett might have jumped ship back in 2021 but instead Essendon’s only final berth in the past six years coincided with his season of free agency.  

By a fluke of timing he falsely thought Essendon might have a bright future.  

After some equivocation he re-signed with Essendon in June that year months ahead of that finals berth and given rival free agency offers he locked himself in for six years.  

Not a two-year deal to unrestricted free agency (and total control of his destiny) but a whopper with the lot through to 2027.  

He re-signed in June 2021, Essendon then squeaked into finals with an 11-11 win-loss record and was bashed up by the Dogs in another elimination finals demolition (49 points).  

The club hasn’t played finals since.  

Ironically, the Dons trumpeted his signing on their website as “Merrett a Bomber for Life”.  

Remarkably, Ridley has actually signed three contract extensions since October 2020.  

In 2020 after a Crichton Medal victory the key defender signed a four-year deal to free agency in 2024.  

Then only a year later in September 2021 he extended his deal by two seasons to 2026 after another bumper season.  

Then in February 2024 he signed on for a further three seasons to 2029, saying he was “proud to have the opportunity to play for such a great club for such a long time”.  

So Ridley willingly signed away his restricted free agency rights, then signed away his unrestricted free agency rights, but now wants out because Essendon is ordinary.  

He is right — they are ordinary.",0.9992,pos

These are all the interstate (and Geelong) teams who have won the grand final against a Melbourne based club since 2000. I've included 2020 and 2021 as all Vic teams played finals interstate.

They want as many Geelong supporters to watch as possible and that would be 40k at the MCG but 20k at Geelong if it was between Geel v Coll. That is why Chris Scott requests all home games in Geelong  during h&a but dismisses any questions about finals as it isn't beneficial to the supporters and doesn't provide much tactical benefit to the team (travelling to the MCG to watch is considered better than not getting a ticket).

Is your idea of fairness that Collingwood should be able to request to play our final against Brisbane at Adelaide Oval? That is the ground we play best and it would shoot Brisbane in the foot twice as they miss out on a game at the MCG.

The real equity issue is should the AFL lose revenue to allow teams to play at smaller stadiums when most of the home ground advantage is lost because both clubs' members have equal access to tickets? Should West Coast, Adelaide, Freo etc. get taxed more because one club wanted 45,000 spectators rather than 100,000 spectators at a final?",0.9698,pos

A) You can't get a father son, free agent, or academy player if you finished top 8, ergo a top side has to trade to get access to these benefits and the bottom sides get the trade value.

B) Any Academy/NGA drafted gets a monetary salary cap benefit to the original club so that the so called incentive isn't taken away (even though the point of them isn't to make clubs better but to grow the game - but this noble intention has been maliciously hijacked and distorted).

Brisbane, Hawthorn, Collingwood and Sydney have all had years in the bottom 4 in the last decade but are well-run enough to rebuild quickly, with Geelong a ‘mini-rebuild’ (missing finals once on two occasions) 

Where the AFL has failed to make the competition even comes down to the draw and its flow on effects. More so for Collingwood & Geelong and a lesser extent hawthorn. Those two clubs get a fixture that gets them 2/3 more wins per year (the diff between top 4 & top 8) through no travel to Tassie, Darwin, Canberra etc. Compare how many grounds the bulldogs, GWS, GC, Freo play at during the season. Not only does it get them more wins, it provides an uneven advantage when it comes to trading and free agency as the big crowd/game factor is a key pillar of the negotiations.

If you’d told me in 2001 that Geelong and Sydney would be two of the dominant teams of the next 20 years and that Essendon and North Melbourne would be two of the worst performed teams I’d have laughed you out of the room. 

But the Bombers and the Roos in particular have been victims of poor draft choices, poor management, poor decisions off-field. The AFL can only do so much. 

A team like the Tigers are great example of different management strategies. They’ve finished on top once on this period, only played five prelims, but won three flags - one fewer than the Cats, Lions and Hawks but one more than the Magpies. And now they’re on the way down again. 

The Lions? They were a laughing stock less than a decade ago. The Hawks? They haven’t won a flag in a decade.

I mean let’s look at what is (was) wrong with their club over the past 25 years and why they haven’t been successful:

* Sheedy just wouldn’t move the fuck on and lingered like a bad smell for too damn long.
* Hird made himself bigger than the club and wouldn’t just fuck off
* Power brokers in the club, including Sheedy, conspired for years to try to get Hird back into the position of head coach

Of all the AFL clubs, the Bombers are the ones that act most like an “old boys club.”

Seriously though, seemed AFL were punishing Sydney at the time for taking advantage of systems they had in place at the time to attempt ""equality"" for teams that were at a disadvantage (free agency and COLA).

Since then, we've seen free agency benefit top teams more and more, and struggling teams with ""war chests"" unable to lure big fish - then eventually overpaying for B grade players as it's the best they can do with the money.At the same time, they lose their own players to free agency, often being ""over-compensated"" with high end draft picks (ie. Theyre incentivised to give up key players).

On the player end - free agency does more for top players than it does for fringe players. Top players line up their contracts with free agency, their agents shop them around (usually to the clubs with war chests), leak rumours to the press, then sign to their existing club at a premium, or go wherever they want without having to be party to a trade to compensate their existing club. ""Restricted"" free agency is a load of crap, teams so rarely match offers for players fhat have publicly said they want out and have large contracts in front of them (often manipulated in ways that make them hard to match).

So free agency, whilst has some benefits for players in getting to where they want, and for competing teams to plug holes in their lists, is absolutely not an eqalualisation tool.",0.8839,pos

We had a list manager who might have seen talent, but overrated draft picks to get it on a trade and when he did trade draft picks missed a great draft.(missing Bobby Hill, Josh Dunkley, but then trading in Shiel for 2 firsts), didn’t know how to be ruthless on contracts.   So so players have had 7-10 year careers.

Squandered some elite father son talent(Daniher) and persisted with some that weren’t going to make it(take your pick).

The deck is clear.   Merrett is just the last fed up player with the above.

The new setup is now properly professional and will get the job done.  It’s just a hard bloody road because of it.

Extra game at home due to gather round. Of the 4 top 8 teams they played once, only Fremantle was away from Adelaide.

They didn't beat a top 8 side outside of Adelaide. Inaccurate kicking cost Brisbane, Collingwood dominated the game in Adelaide but couldn't put it on the scoreboard due to their lack of composure going forward. Hawthorn over possessed the ball and kept turning the ball over as the result of going for the extra release handball and putting themselves under more pressure until they turned it over.

Compare that to Hawthorn that only played 3 games against the bottom 3 sides and have had a lot of their best players out of form at various parts of the year. The only 3 of Hawthorn's higher end players you could say have had a consistently good year were the 3 that made the All Australian Team.

Collingwood missed in 2004, Brisbane missed in 2005 and Port missed in 2008 throughout the 2000s.

Eight times in these 14 seasons (1980 to 1993) the GF loser got belted, eight times they made the finals the following year, five times they made the Grand Final, four times they won the premiership the following year after that GF belting.

So it's not really indicative of a trend. It's 50% harder to make the Grand Final after losing one than it used to be because there are 50% more teams now than there were in 1980.

Now let's do all Grand Final losers for the 18-team competition, not just the ones that lost games by a margin larger than an arbitrary 40-point limit.

I think GC beat Lions. Lions are missing Neale and Hipwood. Two pretty critical pieces.


Crows Vs. Hawks. I don't have a Scooby Doo. 


Hawks were nearly top 4 until the final weekend. So way stronger than a typical 8th placed team. Hawks have also been a bogey side for the Crows and have more finals experience.


Crows finished minor premiers giving them the largest ever ladder jump (15 to 1). No previous finals experience. Michalanney will move back into defence (1 game since injury) and Rachele is back. Massive ins.


AFL media might have jynxed the crows. They have an article up about how the Hawks need to overcome 42 years of history to beat the Crows.


""The last team to finish on top of the ladder and lose two straight finals was North Melbourne way back in 1983.""


So Crows could make history again. But not in a good way.

Freddy is crucial to team structure. Even in this loss. 
You’re a clown if you think you know better than the entire match selection committee at a pro football club. 
Freo and any footy club are more than one play by one player. 
I could find moments even the best superstars have costs games for their side. 
Doesn’t change their body of work. 
Freddy is always adhering to his role and plays out of his skin. 

His role is dependant on others if he’s to be dominant though. 
Not many if any, half forwards in the modern age can turn a game on its head. 
The types that can are polling Brownlow votes. 

The future stays bright over at Freo. 
This finials campaign was never going to end in glory. But the team fought to make it when all the chips were down. 

There’s shades of 2019 Brisbane about this side. 
It may not happen next year. But counting Freo out with this side currently is something a fan can do at their own risk. It takes time to craft a champion team. 

Pushing a far better side like the dogs out to play finals in the first place shows this team. (The 3rd least experienced in the league) had a path ahead that is still attainable for the cellar dwellers if they get it right.
