From [afl.com.au](https://www.afl.com.au/news/1297033/cats-star-set-to-face-afl-sanction-for-flipping-off-fan) in April:

  
GEELONG star Bailey Smith has been fined $1000 by the AFL for his offensive gesture, as he warned rival fans ""don't talk s\*\*\* to the skipper"".

Smith starred for the Cats in their stirring comeback win over¬†Adelaide on Thursday night, tallying a game-high 35 disposals, six clearances and one goal in an influential display.

But some of the shine was taken off the 24-year-old's performance when he was caught on video giving a double-""bird"" salute to a Crows fan as Geelong players walked down the race.

Footage of the Adelaide Oval incident quickly circulated on social media and it soon emerged Smith was reacting to taunts directed at Cats skipper Patrick Dangerfield.

The AFL fined him $1500 for making an obscene gesture and he can accept $1000 with an early plea.

""It was probably not my best moment but I was just walking off getting around the fans and then someone was just getting stuck into Danger a bit more than he should have,"" Smith told Channel Seven on Friday.

""We were in enemy territory and I kind of love that sort of stuff. I love the back and forth between the fans.

""If I had my time again I probably shouldn't have done the double-bird, but it's just all part of it and there's only so much you can cop ... but don't talk s\*\*\* to the skipper, I guess.""

Smith said he was simply flying the flag for Dangerfield, who was a predictable target for Adelaide fans all night as he kicked four goals to help sink his former team.

""He can't do it. He's got a good image to uphold, whereas I'm a bit different,"" Smith said of Dangerfield.

""I just don't like some of the stuff that was being said.

""Obviously you want to win with grace and that (gesture) wasn't anything untoward towards the Adelaide Crows in general, just the one bloke that was making a big effort to get stuck into Danger.""

Pressed for details, Smith said the supporter had been vocal about Dangerfield's time with Adelaide before getting personal in his verbal attack.

""That's where it just crosses a line,"" Smith said.

""You can judge performance as much as you like but when you start to get into deeper details it's probably a bit far.""",0.9207,pos

- Jack Gunston, played 2 years, decided to leave for Hawks (a strong team). Didn't want to attend awards night. So he was stripped of his best young player award.¬†


I think it is because he showed so much promise, left to a premiership favourite, didn't want to attend awards night.


- Kurt Tippett, was highest paid on the list at the time. Had a clause on his contract that he could break the contract to return home to GC. Decided to leave for Sydney, tried to use that clause. Then showed Sydney that he had been paid dodgy. Sydney used as leverage. Then Crows missed out on the first round of draft picks for 3 years and 2nd round for 2 years.


Crows shouldn't have done it. But also throwing the club under the bus for leverage hurt everyone. Disliked for trying to force the club into the contract, then using that contract to force his way to the Swans.


- Jake Lever, he was at the Crows for 3 years. He slid on draft night due to injury. Went on for like 5 min about how he loves the club and wants to repay the faith in the club after his value had dropped when drafted. Had a great season in 2017 with Brian Taylor (a family friend of his) glazing over everything he did. Took a massive contract at the demons. Refused to go to the awards night (he was invited). Was seen throwing all his Crows stuff out at the tip (didn't donate it to charity or anything). Then through his dad started leaking stuff to the press to make Lever seem better. Most was false, easy to tell as it kept changing when more info came to light. Like that he wasn't invited to the awards night, or that the players didn't want him there (players were texting him to come).


Disliked because of how much he said he would repay the crows for selecting him on draft night, muck raking when leaving, and essentially being rude about the Crows.


- Contrary to popular belief, most Crows fans don't dislike players for leaving, see Jarryd Lyons, Ed Curnow, Patrick Dangerfield, Burnie Vince, Mitch McGovern, Shane McAdam, Charlie Cameron, Hugh Greenwood, Josh Jenkins, Eddie Betts, Phil Davis, Nathan Bock, and probably more I can't remember.",0.9958,pos

For example, my club Melbourne has a charcuterie test. You need to place twelve different charcuterie items in their correct place on the board. There is some flexibility allowed, particularly if you display elite winter sports skills, but you should never ever mix your cheeses and meats.

Before becoming a Collingwood supporter, you'll need to have a dental exam. The dentist will sign a form confirming that you are missing at least one third of your teeth. They'll then put the form inside a locked car. If you manage to break into the car and get the form within sixty seconds, you're golden.

If you're interested in becoming an Essendon supporter, you'll be taken into a room and forced to watch the pawn shop scene from Pulp Fiction. Afterwards, you'll be asked ""If this was real life, which character from this scene would you like to be?"" Pick anyone but Bruce Willis and you'll be fine.

St. Kilda has a skills test, I believe. If you can kick a footy further than 10m there's a good chance they'll offer you a playing contract for 2026.

Finally, I heard that Adelaide are updating their test for 2026. Something about a trip to San Francisco. Not really sure about the details.

Extra game at home due to gather round. Of the 4 top 8 teams they played once, only Fremantle was away from Adelaide.

They didn't beat a top 8 side outside of Adelaide. Inaccurate kicking cost Brisbane, Collingwood dominated the game in Adelaide but couldn't put it on the scoreboard due to their lack of composure going forward. Hawthorn over possessed the ball and kept turning the ball over as the result of going for the extra release handball and putting themselves under more pressure until they turned it over.

Compare that to Hawthorn that only played 3 games against the bottom 3 sides and have had a lot of their best players out of form at various parts of the year. The only 3 of Hawthorn's higher end players you could say have had a consistently good year were the 3 that made the All Australian Team.

With Adelaide though, I really don‚Äôt think any club at the organisational level would‚Äôve handled it as poorly as the Crows did. Given how prominent AFL gay rights have been over the last month even outside of the Rankine incident - discourse around Snoop Dogg, Mitch Brown - Adelaide managed to miss every single chance to rehab their image. It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even think the process of *cynically* projecting support for gay rights was worth the effort. You‚Äôve basically signalled to the supporter base that the club doesn‚Äôt care about gay people, which emboldens some supporters to act more feral. And then the nail in the coffin is not calling a spade a spade after last week and instead hoping people will forget this whole thing once it‚Äôs out of the news cycle. I just don‚Äôt think any other club would‚Äôve have blundered their messaging at every possible stage and I think it truly does reflect, at best, institutional indifference to gay rights in sports, which is also disappointing considering the gay representation in the Crows women‚Äôs team. 

The whole thing is a PR shitshow that could be studied and now Adelaide are gonna be branded as the homophobic club (which given all this isn‚Äôt really unfair).

I think GC beat Lions. Lions are missing Neale and Hipwood. Two pretty critical pieces.


Crows Vs. Hawks. I don't have a Scooby Doo.¬†


Hawks were nearly top 4 until the final weekend. So way stronger than a typical 8th placed team. Hawks have also been a bogey side for the Crows and have more finals experience.


Crows finished minor premiers giving them the largest ever ladder jump (15 to 1). No previous finals experience. Michalanney will move back into defence (1 game since injury) and Rachele is back. Massive ins.


AFL media might have jynxed the crows. They have an article up about how the Hawks need to overcome 42 years of history to beat the Crows.


""The last team to finish on top of the ladder and lose two straight finals was North Melbourne way back in 1983.""

I hate what they've done, or probably more accurately what they didn't do. The list of what we didn't do includes not training the players on not slurring before the incident happened (you might not think this needs to happen, but a third of the clubs so far have had an incident so clearly its a whole league issue), not imposing our own ban on rankine before the afl even had a chance to do it, not making him face the media before he went away, not making apologise to the effected people, not publicly saying before the game for supporters to pull their head in, Nicks not condemning the booing in the press conference. This list of what we didn't do more accurately represents what the problems are to me as they aren't just the actions of an individual saying a hurtful word, its the actions of an entire organisation seemingly endorsing it by not condemning it. Its just fucked and I'm sorry to all the people effected by this.",-0.9251,neg

2: I didn't think Bailey Smith would have that great of a season, I thought his kicking was too much of a liability.

3: I didn't have Adelaide rising up the ladder by this much. I thought their offseason was a 10/10, but I didn't trust Nicks to steer the ship.

4: I thought Sydney would have some growing pains under Dean Cox, but I thought they could at least be good enough to make a semi-final.

5: My suspicion was that Collingwood would bomb out badly in a prelim after too many old guys get injured, so far this is yet to be determined. I didn't expect them to spend most of the season as uncrowned minor premiers, however.

6: I thought GWS were either going to make a prelim or finish 9th without much in between. My suspicion that their midfield needed a lot of work was mostly proven correct, although Finn Callaghan had a much better season than I was expecting. I thought Hogan would have a much better season and Idun would finally make AA like he's deserved the last two seasons. Wrong on both.

7: I thought Port Adelaide would have their struggles, but at least would be able to rally at the end of the season and finish 6th-9th. In general I expected the finals race to feature a bunch more teams, and we wouldn't have such a clear top and bottom 9 in the competition.

8: I thought that 2024 was going to be the toughest season for homophobia in the league, and the AFL players would have learned their lesson :(

Pure small club victim mentality, they have this delusion that they're somehow a ""real"" team while West Coast is a corporation because they've been huffing copium for their entire existence.

Part of the thing about not playing the big clubs down at KP is that we don't get to see some of the best stars down there, so Fyfe was a true exception to that.

He was always worth the price of admission, can't miss footy. I'll never forget him getting spun in the air parallel to the ground and somehow managed to fire a handpass out to a teammate 25m up the ground on the run to set up a Freo goal, he was cool as the other side of the pillow.

The game vs Adelaide where he and Danger went 1v1 was probably the greatest matchup I've ever seen, two of my favourite players ever just going up against it.
