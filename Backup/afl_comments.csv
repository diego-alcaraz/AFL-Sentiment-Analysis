Worse than QANTAS, worse than Public Transport Victoria, just glib statements that pass the buck and screw you over. It‚Äôs scandalous.

‚ÄúTicketek has admitted its booking system isn‚Äôt actually a queue but more like a lottery. Punters on social media reported confusion around the ticketing process; some who had been waiting on a loading screen since opening were left without tickets, while others who logged on well after were able to quickly secure seats.

That‚Äôs because Ticketek doesn‚Äôt allocate tickets on a first come, first served basis. Rather, once a person has logged into the waiting ‚Äúlounge‚Äù, they are picked at random.‚Äù"
ne9on0a,hamleyn248,-16,1757897795.0,Completely agree. I also don't see how that is at all fair.

nehecpk,ZestyBro,3,1758004975.0,The process is different now than for TS tickets. TS ticket queue it just refreshed every 10 seconds and if there was a free slot you got in. Now you go into a waiting room and then when the on sale time starts you get put into a proper queue (they say randomly)
ne9u4yz,proudlysydney,22,1757899760.0,"It's actually fairer to avoid bots that are able to log in to the waiting room within milliseconds of it opening.
