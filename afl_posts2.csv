So I went with an Aussie mate to an Edinburgh pub at 5am to watch the Finals and I had an absolute blast (even though we were rooting for the Cats. Sad times)

I've decided to properly follow the league next year and I obviously don't wanna bandwagon on Cats or Lions, even though I kinda love some of their players!

SO... I looked at standings, team colours, listened to all the team songs (y'all really need some updates there lmao), looked for players with funny names or interesting strengths and I think I've landed on my 2 favourites:  
Freemantle Dockers  
Collingwood Magpies

What I wanna know is, who are the most notable players in AFL?  
Not necessarily the ""best"" (for example, Jayson Tatum in one of the best players in NBA but not as notable or interesting for a casual fan as others)

Who is the biggest or toughest bastard in the league?  
Who's fastest?  
Who has most potential?  
Who is a good villain?  
Who starts fights?  
Who grabs the most ridiculous speccys?

Stuff like that will really help me get on board!

Cheers in advance, from the only other country where cunt just means person."

Brisbane lions 
5 premierships (1 3 peat, 1 back to back)
1 wooden spoon 
Total win loss including finals (312-289-6)

Geelong 
4 premierships (no repeats)
0 wooden spoons
Total win loss including finals (406-208-6)

Hawks
4 premierships (1 3 peat)
0 wooden spoons 
Total win loss including finals (335-267-4)

Lions have the most flags, a 3 peat and a back to back, but had a barren run between those finals runs, including a wooden spoon 

Geelong have been the most consistent, finals nearly every year, 15 of the last 20 years in the top 4, but never had back to back success in September. 

Hawks have 4 flags, including a 3 peat, and sit somewhere in between Geelong and Brisbane in terms of overall win loss, and never bottomed out the way the lions did.

So what's your thoughts everyone, do the lions take the cake with the most flags, does Geelongs consistency put them on top, do the mighty Hawks of 2013-15 put them above the rest, or is there an argument for somebody else? 

Edit* I'm talking about club over a 25 year period, not a single year team, sorry that wasn't made clear in my original post. "

Now that the offseason is officially upon us, the natural next phase of the subreddit is the trade period shenanigans.

I would just like to cordially remind everyone that none of us are actually the list managers of the clubs we support, nor is the subreddit the negotiating table around which the *actual* list managers will nut out the deals.

What that means is, whilst it can be fun to speculate on who will go where, and for what price they will be traded, you don't actually have to remind your opponent that you 'hold all the cards' or threaten to 'let him walk to the preseason draft'. You're not a list manager, so you can't actually do any of those things, and the person you're arguing is also not a list manager, so they can't be threatened by them.

By all means, let's talk about who's leaving (JMcV üò≠) but can we please let BigFooty maintain a monopoly on grandstanding tough-talking wannabe hostage negotiators?

I like the vibe at r/AFL when it's jovial and friendly, and trade period often brings down the mood a bit. Maybe if someone is being a bit of a tit, just reply with a link to this post.

Thanks all. Carry on üëç"

On a thread on¬†[r/NRL](https://www.reddit.com/r/NRL/)¬†if the Super League didn't happen, one of the commenters said the Lions and Swans would still be getting two men and a dog to their games, and I guess it's half right seeing how many people admitted of turning to AFL because of the Super League war."

Now its the right time to get down to business on next season. And we'll start at the very top of the tree. Pre Season.

Some will agree with it, some will not. 

Now coming out of the 2025 pre season, they have been massive headaches coming out of it. Particularly the length of the competition phase of it.

What's really concerning is that when players come back after training hard during the summer, its down the match simulations & practice matches. On paper they only have two games, which quite frankly is not enough to really shake off competitive rust and get into match shape for the big season. What we seen early this season is heaps of players coming into the season not in the best condition and not enough preparation.

Teams & players need at least 4 games instead of the 1 match simulation & 1 official practice match they play. I was reading articles on the issues at maybe at these 3 to 4 official games in the pre season period.

In my opinion, I have an absolute dislike on what the pre season has become for the last 12 years, bottom line I think it absolutely sucks, its boring with nothing but these practice matches where there is nothing at stake.

I'm a heavy advocate at the same time to bring back the pre season cup for a long time. At one time the pre season cup was a big thing, you see big grand finals for the trophy at Marvel Stadium and massive crowd attendance. During the late 80's-90's club just wanted to compete, you lookback at St Kilda's win in 1996 that was massive for the club and its fans. And then there was the 2000's, the 2004 St Kilda team looking like sour salty's after winning a trophy, a few clubs were pleased to win the cup, especially Geelong in 2006 & the Western Bulldogs in 2010. But after 2013, after Brisbane won the trophy, it was gone.

I've said this in one of my earlier post, why not turn the series into a 3 to 4 game instead of bringing back the old knockout cup. Similar to the NRL's pre season challenge cup which they introduced in 2023, clubs play 3 or 4 games, ladder scoring with 4 pts for a win, 2 pts for a draw and percentage and bonus points for the amount the margin won by. 1 pts for a 25 pts and over win, 2 pts for a 50 pts and over & 3 pts for a 75 pts and over.

Now to make it worthwhile for clubs, why not bump the prize money to about $500,000, give 200K to the winning club, 200K to the playing group and since its the AFL Community Series, make it about community so the winning club get 100K to donate to a charity of their choice and the trophy of course.

Now, teams could use the series to not only their test their gameplans and new recruits, but also have more time to be prepared and be in playing condition for the home & away season, but also get the competitive juices going at attempting to win something, and also build a winning culture among a club.

Just my thought."

If it was up to me I would argue to remove them but I know that‚Äôs a very unpopular opinion to a lot of the fans of AFL. But that doesn‚Äôt change the issue that teams stay good and teams stay Bad so I had an idea.

What if: When a team bids for a FS or Academy player. Along with matching the point amount they must give up their next year future pick equal to the round that they bid on the player for to the club that they bid against. 

In the situation that a team does not have their future pick next year then they can not access the father son or academy system

This is in attempt to allow teams to get FS but not stop low ladder teams from lose out on players they should be getting. It also caps how many Academy and FS a single team can get in a year which stops teams like GC from getting multiple first round Academy picks.
Like I said before. Most are for father sons, but I am for having a fair and equal competition and I want teams like North and West coast to not be uncompetitive for long periods of time. 
If it was up to me it should be if you want a player in the draft yoy trade for their pick but I think this is a fair compromise to that."

I thought I‚Äôd put the word out to see if anyone wanted to be involved in a new build of the app.¬† You‚Äôd be an ideal candidate if you:

* Have mobile app design or development experience.
* Have some spare time to contribute; there will be no individual deadlines but we have 5 months to get the release out the door.
* Are comfortable working as part of a team, contributing to and adhering to decisions, coding standards, reviewing code, etc.
* Are familiar with (or are willing to learn) git.
* Bonus points if you have some experience with Android environment management and CI/CD as this uncharted territory for me.

This could also be a good opportunity to add features that you would love to see in the app but I never got around to adding (eg, an actual ladder or advanced stats).

Also if you‚Äôre keen to investigate how we could potentially bring in some other sports - I get a lot of requests for NRL, NBL and cricket but I haven‚Äôt had the time to identify a reliable data source and understand the data models, etc.

I don‚Äôt think this is a Victorian media bias thing cause I remember going into the 2023 GF they were given much more of a chance against Collingwood that year. This year it was different though, they were given much less of a chance. I just found it bizarre how little credit the reigning premiers were given this week with people saying it was Geelong‚Äôs flag to lose. Sure they were a bit battered and bruised coming into the game but this is a finals hardened team with big game players all over the park.

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying Geelong didn‚Äôt deserve to be favourites. They earned that right by being the form team of the comp over the last couple months and pumped Brisbane only a couple weeks ago but I thought Brisbane should‚Äôve got more respect than they did leading into this game and felt a bit disregarded "

I know im hardly a neutral here, because my team won the spoon, possibly my favourite player since Cuz retired to concussion and my second/bandwagon team got beaten by a point in an elim final. 

That being said, I feel like ""opening"" round this year was a farce, the only upside the it was hopefully now its dead as a door knob. 

The 15m rule 'benefit of the doubt' - now being called play on instead of a mark. It's confusing, terrible and clearly the players hate it. Don't think this will change next year given the premier averages 200 million uncontested marks a game

We saw the best and ther very worst of the MRO/Tribunal. Alex Pearce not being suspened and Tom Lynch being given 5 weeks stand out as the most sensible descions. Steven May getting 3 weeks seems on the other end of this spectrum, and personally I found the descions bizzare to no even cite Toby Greene for trying batter both of Harley's heads with his elbow(head)/the ball(balls) and Moore for trying to give Traceys kidneys the Lonergan treatment after taking a game saving mark.

Could ramble on and on, but what are your first takes after 2025?

However Brisbane have set themselves apart by having 3 players shake hands with children multiple times bringing their Child Handshake Coefficient to what is potentially an all time record of 25.

The Child Handshake Coefficient is calculated by dividing handshakes with children (which we'll call H) by the number of players who failed to shake children's hands (which we'll call F) in the grand final post match ceremony.

A note on methodology: instances where a player demonstrated intent to handshake a child which was not reciprocated have been marked as a handshake, however high fives and fist bumps have been marked as a failure to handshake.

**Please note the child handshake section of 2024's grand final is not available online** and the same can be said of most grand finals pre-2020 so the dataset is too small to glean potential correlations between the Child Handshake Coefficient and future finals performance. It is worth noting however that Melbourne have not made finals since 2021. Maybe they shook too many children's hands? Food for thought.

Good? Bad? How come?

My opinion? Feels very shallow. I don't mind the idea of kids being mic'd up and having a chance to speak to a star, but these are lines concocted by the broadcast team that the kids need to rehearse and say on command. Feels like catering to the lowest common denominator viewer with how unsubtle it all is.

If I was to be more cynical, intentionally sending a kid out to say ""I wanna be just like you"" to Cam Rayner specifically seems like ragebait given he is arguably the ""villain"" of the finals series."

Congrats to them once again for going back to back. Know of any other cool stats? Drop a comment below.


- This is Geelongs fifth lowest score in a V/AFL Grand Final, scoring 11.9-75. Their lowest was 7.8-50 points in 2020 vs Richmond, second being 8.15-63 in 1994 vs West Coast, third being 8.17-65 in 1953 vs Collingwood, fourth being 9.14-68 in 1931 vs Richmond.

- This is Brisbane‚Äôs second highest scoring Grand Final at 18.14-122. Their highest score standing at 20.14-134 in 2003 vs Collingwood.

- Brisbanes final quarter was their highest scoring quarter across their entire season, kicking 9.5-59, beating their last record of 8.4-52 earlier in the year. 

- A stat that was shown on the AFL app, Brisbane had been 6-0 when Charlie Cameron had scored 3 goals or more during the 2025 season. Today has now made it 7-0.

- Brisbanes second half score of 13.8-86 is now the 4th highest scoring second half in V/AFL Grand Final history (Second if counting just AFL), with Third and Second belonging to Essendon (with 13.11-89 in 1946 and 15.5-95 in 1985) Melbourne still holds that record in 2021 vs Western Bulldogs at a mighty 16.5-101.

- Brisbanes second half score sits 5th as the highest scoring half (First and Second) in a V/AFL Grand Final game. 4th belongs to Essendon (13.11-89, Second Half in 1946), 3rd is, again, Essendon (15.5-95, Second Half in 1985), 2nd to Melbourne (16.5-101, Second Half in 2021), 1st still standing to Carlton, for their record holding 18.6-114 in a single half of a Grand Final in 1972.

- This is Geelong‚Äôs highest conceded game across the 2025 season at 122 points, beating their 113 point conceded against Western Bulldogs. Geelong still won that game.

- This is Geelong‚Äôs third lowest score for the entire 2025 season at 11.9-75. Their lowest score for the 25 season was 6.15-51, versus (might not be a coincidence here), Brisbane.

- This is also Geelong‚Äôs biggest losing margin of the 2025 season, at a 47 point defeat. Their second highest defeat was also against Brisbane in the same game as above, losing 6.15-51 to 14.8-92, a 41 point loss.

- This game snapped Geelong‚Äôs 8 game streak of scoring 100+ points in a game, after having lost 17.9-111/13.7-85 to the Giants. It‚Äôs also their 10th game for the season that they have failed to score more than 100+ points. 

- Dayne Zorko had 23 kicks for the whole game, with 21 kicks being effective, a high 91% efficiency when kicking. Harris Andrews had kicked 13 times with 12 being effective, giving him a 92.3% efficiency (although he kicked it 10 times less than Zorko, which doesn‚Äôt sound as impressive). 

- Jack Martin, Oisin Mullin, Shannon Neale & Rhys Stanley had 100% efficiency when kicking, although they only kicked it once, twice, 3 and 3 times respectively the whole game.

- Logan Morris was more inefficient in kicking, having kicked 8 times, only 3 to advantage. Alongside Tyson Stengel, who kicked 9 times and was only effective 3 times. Will Ashcroft was also less effective, kicking it 20 times and only having 9 to advantage.

- Ty Gallop had 0 kicks to advantage. He only kicked twice.

- Harris Andrews was the only player on the ground to have not touched the interchange bench the entire game, standing at 100% playtime on the ground.

- Cam Rayner held the game highest 7 clangers for the whole game, with Bailey Smith and Max Holmes trailing with 5 apiece

- Will Ashcroft has become the third player to win back to back Norm Smith medal, sharing that honour with Andrew McCloud for his Norm Smith medals in 1997 & 1998, and Dustin Martin in 2019 & 2020. He also joins the likes of  Luke Hodge and Gary Ayres to win multiple Norm Smith Medals.

- Will Ashcroft now holds the distinct honour of being the youngest player ever to hold two Norm Smith medals at the age of 20 & 21. (However not the youngest, as this honour belongs to Wayne Harmes, who won at the age of 19 in 1979). This may not be a record beaten for a long time.

- Some areas where Will Ashcroft won to claim the Norm Smith: Disposals: 32 (2nd), Tackles: 8 (1st), Score Involvements: 10 (Tied 1st), Inside 50‚Äôs: 9 (Tied 1st), 575M Gained

- Brisbane have now become the first team to win 5 flags in the AFL era (2000‚Äôs onwards), beating Geelong and Hawthorn with 4 flags each.

Should we look to handicap the premier to encourage more top 4 turnover? If the premier wanted to draft a round 1/2 player they would have to trade up to them.

* Who missed finals this year and also have the longest premiership drought? St Kilda.

Therefore I think we can make a conclusion.

Thank you for coming to the first off-season post.

dont forget ten years ago, the 2v3 matchup happened in a grand final with the original loser of the QF winning by 46 (47 in this case).

The next year the doggies broke their 62 year drought.

**NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON A LION.**

For the second time in the 21st Century, the Brisbane Lions have repeated as Premiers, and they are the first club to 5 premierships in the 21st Century

A deadset brilliant team - Every time this year it looked like they might be in the shit, be it bad form and a tough road game, an injury list a mile long, getting smashed in the Qualifying Final and losing Lachie Neale for what looked like the season‚Ä¶

They responded.

Every. Damn. Time.

Bloody brilliant, Chris Fagan further cements himself as one of the best coaches ever seen, plus some top personal displays everywhere - Charlie Cameron coming up huge as a small forwards, Harris Andrews cleaning up Shannon Neale, Zac Bailey was very good despite his bad case of Brisbehinds, Ashcroft & Fletcher - Just about everywhere you looked, they had winners in every department, and the feather on top was 9 goals in the last quarter.

It seems like every other coach has haters, except for the new ones (Steven King, McQualter and Carr), interested to hear your thoughts.  "
1nqw5gn,Recognition,QuarterFooty,0,3,1758876329.0,2025-09-26T08:45:29+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nqw5gn/recognition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nqw5gn/recognition/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"This might be a bit of a long winded post so bear with me on this.

How there has a lot of talk about recognition with certain accolades. Whether if its individual or clubs, wanting to add to the total, or recognizing place getting in the prestigious awards. 

Now I'm going to split this into two halves. First we'll go into the debate about the Brownlow Medal and a medal for the runner up & third place. Now as a footy fan, I'm all about acknowledging players who have had an outstanding season, if the AFL wanted to present a medal to 2nd & 3rd in the Brownlow Medal, they could do it after the event, but not on the actual night, because it should be all about the Brownlow Medalist. One Collingwood legend said in an article released today said that the AFL shouldn't do it. And that legend was none other than Peter Diacos, the father of 2nd place in this year's Brownlow Medal Nick. 

Prior to 1982, the runner up in the Grand Final received a medal in recognition of a great season to get to the Grand Final, but the practice was abolished after certain event during the 1981 presentation. Now I've seen photos of the runner up medal from later years and I'm curious if the AFL still present the runner up with a medal after the Grand Final? Someone help me with that question. So back to the Brownlow scenario, if they wanted to go down that path, then it should be after the Brownlow is done. And what next, are they going to present medals to the runner up in the Coleman Medal too, mind you there are a long list of great players that were runner up in the leading goalkicker stakes, or what else split the Norm Smith Medal into two and award it to the best player on both teams. 

Speaking about premierships, there have been talk about clubs applying for their VFA premierships to be added to their VFL/AFL totals. Its all well and good for clubs to acknowledge their achievements from premierships, night series/pre season cups, minor premierships to McClelland Trophies, to reserves & under-19 flags or even other Championships like the old Championship of Australia. But here is where the line is drawn. The VFA is now what's currently known as the VFL today, its a total different league, back in 1897 when the 8 foundation clubs broke-off from the original VFA to create the original VFL, now known as the AFL today. So how can you combine accomplishments from one league and the official record of the VFL/AFL? "

It felt like a cyclical dive into drinking culture and nightclubs which didn't keep me engaged but I suppose it's a reality for some AFL players. I appreciated that the novel had a different perspective of the game; as someone who hasn't been in the sport world I got to see the pressure and camaraderie between teammates. There were some crazy twists and reminders of recent drug scandals but I wanted to get more sport-specific scenes from the book. Would love to hear the thoughts of anyone else.

The club has been the opposite of a destination for more than two decades.

Essendon has been shit my whole fkn life (I‚Äôm 29) and we haven‚Äôt won a final in 21 years. The problem is obviously foundational, and the club desperately needs a clean-out. He‚Äôs one of the top players in the league, and the Bombers have given him nothing in return.

He turned up to the Brownlow, and he‚Äôs reported to be turning up to the B&F.

Maybe I‚Äôm a deadset dingus for thinking positively about this, but I actually reckon him threatening to leave is a good thing for the club. He‚Äôs basically saying: get your shit together and clean out the club, or I‚Äôm gone. I think he‚Äôll be glad to stay if he sees a positive change in the next few weeks.

Hopefully we can all be level-headed and not complain about unfairness at these levels to answer my questions.

Since 4th and 5th round picks are now worth no points does that mean they can also be matched with no points?  So you basically get them as a freeby if they go past pick 54 with your 20th round pick (rounds continue until nobody wants to take further picks)?  Any remaining academy players can effectively just be added to their respective team's open roster spots if the club wants them since nobody else will be able to prevent a match on them?

Also there's some weirdness at picks 53 and 54 in that it's actually impossible to match them with later picks.  Picks earlier but near 53 are also very difficult to match needing very specific spots to match  Is there incentive for clubs who want a late academy player to trade for those two particular picks to give them the option of getting a player who can't be matched by the academy clubs? Conversely would academy clubs want those picks to cover those cases?  Before you say those picks are irrelevant just want to remind that Jack Payne went at 54.

I don't think it actually matters either way in terms of fairness but was just curious if there's any clarity on what happens in these edge cases.  I'm a nerd with numbers so it caught my attention."

Well folks, here we are, the warm-up for Trade Period as the 2025 AFL Grand Final dawns on us, with Brisbane making it 3 consecutive Grand Final appearances, which is only their second-longest Grand Final streak this century, and Geelong, playing in a game which to them is simply known as Saturday, with it being their 10th Grand Final of the AFL era, the first to reach that milestone.

Both teams in their 7th Grand Final in the last 25 years, both vying to become the first team to win 5 premierships in the 21st Century.

----

**GEELONG [](/geelong2) vs BRISBANE LIONS [](/brisbane) - MCG, Saturday 2:30pm AEST/12:30pm AWST/2pm ACST**

For our European friends, 5:30am BST, 6:30am CEST

For our American friends, 12:30am EDT, 11:30pm Friday CDT, 10:30pm Friday MDT, 9:30pm Friday PDT

Now, time for some random crap from me:

-------

- The sixth final between Brisbane and Geelong (Geelong lead 3-2), and the first Grand Final between the teams - The Cats also become the Lions' most common finals matchup.

- Geelong will have played against different clubs in their last 9 Grand Final appearances; West Coast (1994), Carlton (1995), Port Adelaide (2007), Hawthorn (2008), St Kilda (2009), Collingwood (2011), Richmond (2020), Sydney (2022) and Brisbane (2025).

- Both clubs won their most recent premiership against the Sydney Swans - The last Grand Final in which both teams had their last premiership against the same team was 2015, when Hawthorn & West Coast had also won their last premiership against the Swans (2014 & 2006). 

- Brisbane are the fourth team this century to appear in 3 consecutive Grand Finals, joining the 2001-04 Lions, 2007-09 Geelong, and 2012-15 Hawthorn.

- 2025 is the first time since 2010 (Collingwood vs St Kilda) that two teams have played each other 4 times in a season, only the fourth time in the 21st Century that's occurred, after 2003 (Collingwood-Brisbane), 2005 (Sydney-West Coast) and 2010.

- This is the first AFL Grand Final on September 27 since 2014 - Brisbane won the 2003 Grand Final on September 27, and Geelong won in 1952 but lost in 2008. 

- The 2025 Lions match the record of the 2024 Lions and 1977 North Melbourne as the only clubs to play the maximum 27 games in a league season - Hugh McCluggage, Will Ashcroft, Dayne Zorko and Josh Dunkley are the only Lions with 26/26 games thus far. 

- This is the fifth Grand Final under the current Finals system to feature a rematch of the Qualifying Final (2003, 2005, 2006, 2015, 2018) - The Qualifying Final loser is 4-1 in the Grand Final, with 2018 West Coast being the only winner. 

- Geelong's first Grand Final team not to feature Joel Selwood since 1995, there are also no survivors from the 2011 premiership team with Mitch Duncan not playing.

- With Tom Stewart out due to concussion, the Cats do have 12 players from the 2022 Premiership team due to play; Tom Atkins, Mark Blicavs, Jeremy Cameron, Brad Close, Patrick Dangerfield, Sam De Koning, Zach Guthrie, Jack Henry, Gryan Miers, Mark O'Connor and Tyson Stengle.

- With Jarrod Berry injured, the Lions have 17 out of the 23 from last year's Grand Final due to play; Callum Ah Chee, Harris Andrews, Will Ashcroft, Zac Bailey, Charlie Cameron, Josh Dunkley, Jaspa Fletcher, Darcy Fort, Ryan Lester, Kai Lohmann, Hugh McCluggage, Logan Morris, Lachie Neale, Cam Rayner, Brandon Starcevich, Darcy Wilmot & Dayne Zorko.

- Brisbane can become the first club to repeat as premiers twice in the 21st Century, after their 3peat from 2001-03 - For reference, Carlton were the first in the 20th Century (1906-08, 1914-15)

- Josh Dunkley is due to play his fifth Grand Final, making him one of only four active players with 5 Grand Final appearances (Pendlebury, Sidebottom and Luke Parker)

- Mark O'Connor can become the first Irishman to win 2 AFL Premierships.

- Dayne Zorko is the first player to play in a Grand Final after turning 36 since Gary Ablett Jnr in 2020, also joining fellow Lion Alastair Lynch in 2004... both Ablett and Lynch retired after those Grand Finals, and [36 is the amount of fights Lynch had with Daryl Wakelin that day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlPTUi9BBeo)

- 2024-25 Brisbane would be only the third team in league history to repeat as Premiers without a Top 2 finish, joining Adelaide in 1997-98 (4th & 5th) and Richmond in 2019-20 (3rd x2)

- The first Grand Final since 2007 (Mark Thompson vs Mark Williams) in which both coaches have the same first name... although it is technically Christian vs Christopher.

- Chris Scott can join the list of coaches who have defeated the club they played for in a Grand Final, a recent list that includes Craig McRae (2023), Mick Malthouse (2010), Malcolm Blight (1998) and Denis Pagan (1996)

- Chris Fagan breaks his own record as the oldest Grand Final coach in league history... he is the only Premiership coach to win a flag after turning 60.

I was a bit skeptical how we would go this year at the start of the season because of the demographic of our list. But I was happily proven wrong and actually quite happy with how our season went. 

I have seen some people talking about how Collingwood should make some huge changes this off season and Kane Cornes‚Äô comments today essentially saying we should blow up our list and get rid of a lot of our players who were best 22 this year.

I just don‚Äôt understand why Collingwood would cull so many of this years best 22 after falling just short of making a grand final.

Do we in Australia only see the premiers as having a successful season? Does Collingwood need to completely blow up their team to get slightly better than they were this year? In other sports around the world they seem to think winning more games than losing is somewhat successful and making the play offs for some sports is a successful season. But not here."

I vote for 2nd to be called the Nick Daicos medal and 3rd be the Bont.

Firstly, I think the brownlow should be awarded by the coaches as they are the ones who best understand the game and who impacted it. 

This would require the coaches to vote on both the coaches award and the Brownlow,. To solve the his we can also change the coaches award. This can be voted on by the players. 

However, this creates another issue with the players now awarding the AFLPA MVP and the coaches award. To solve this we can change who voted on the AFLPA MVP, to the umpires as they are no longer voting on the Brownlow. "

My prayers were answered as the Lions closed the gap between themselves and the legendary team of the early 2000s by booking their 3rd consecutive Grand Final, thanks in no small part to a flurry of goals in the 'championship quarter'. 

#But how did the Lions kick away in the 3rd?

Close your eyes Magpies fans because this isn't pretty viewing. After going back and re-watching the 3rd quarter it became clear the issues stemmed from stoppage, and rewinding the game even further the signs were there from the onset. 

Now losing to a midfield of McCluggage (37 disposals, 10 clearances and a goal), Bailey (21 disposals, 7 clearances and 2 goals) and Will Ashcroft (20 touches, 5 clearances and 2 goals) it's the way it happened that are less than honourable. 

#*Lack of or poor communication*
There were more than a few examples of Brisbane players getting time and space to themselves at a stoppage, early in the game, with Howe playing spare, Collingwood were able to repel these attacks. But as the game drew on the Brisbane spare kept finding more and more dangerous space.


This one was caught and given graphics on TV so I won't delve into it too deeply. But Bailey wanders into stoppage unopposed, Maynard and Houston both point at him, Maynard makes his move too late and [Bailey kicks a goal largely uncontested] (https://youtu.be/IuxNp9FuavA). Zach Bailey's name is underlined, bolded and circled for a forward 50 stoppage, letting him wander unopposed is likely not in the gameplan.

Rayner was largely held in check for the game, but as with players of his ilk he doesn't need much to get himself going. Her certainly doesn't to run around unopposed but that's what Collingwood do anyway. Rayner wanders into this stoppage, Crisp points at him, Sidebottom points at someone else, ultimately no one goes to Rayner. Schultz misses his handball and as the camera cuts wide to follow Dayne Zorko's opposite foot rainmaker into the 50, Rayner can be spotted crossing the 50 in 10-15m of open space. Ty Gallop does his role, the ball comes to ground and [Quaynor just has too much ground to make up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BP1eYi9ji8).

#Ball Hunting

Now here is the part I have to caveat the 'analysis' (I'm being generous to myself here) by saying obviously I was not involved with the pre match preparation for Collingwood. All I have is the footage I saw from the day, but it isn't pretty. There are several occasions that Collingwood players drop their match-up to hunt the ball and lose the stoppage as a result. 

Was this lapses in concentration? 

Was this the intended gameplan? 

I can't say either way, but if Hugh McCluggage had 22 touches and 5 clearances in a half against my team, I might be asking we put an arm across him in the second half.

*Here are some examples, in no particular order*

[De Goey stops to sweep, the ball sprays wide and McCluggage collects unopposed] (https://youtu.be/d0AJTFDW9O0)

[Crisp starts on McCluggage, leaves him to sit front and centre of the ruck contest, McCluggage collects and goals] (https://youtu.be/l35B2OtCGZk)

[De Goey starts on Ashcroft, wanders into stoppage, McCluggage knocks down handball, finds De Goey's man Ashcroft spreading wide] (https://youtu.be/D6akmgqFomI)

[Sidebottom leaves McCluggage to sweep, Daicos leaves Dunkley to hunt footy, McCluggage wins stoppage with clean hands and Dunkley dumps a kick that is ultimately intercepted] (https://youtu.be/BUnu-M9iZ9g)

#Where do we go from here?

The mind can't help but wander to the holiest day in AFL. A Saturday afternoon in late September. Staying awake, alert and accountable is how Tom Atkins has made it this far in footy. 
After Jai Newcombe won multiple stoppages in a row to start the game against the Crows, [look how Atkins stays connected as the ball goes up, eventually beating Newcombe to the ball and with a well timed shepherd, winning the clearance himself] (https://youtu.be/xVyaw4-s-EE)

Or how Atkins and Smith switch to ensure the better matchup, Atkins follows up by [knocking the tap away from Newcombe, knocking a second handball away from Newcombe and winning his own ball] (https://youtu.be/ndL88Ozsp3o)

Contrast this to Max Holmes, a fantastic midfielder in his own right, who [might not have the same mental fortitude as Atkins, slipping away from this contest letting Newcombe win it] (https://youtu.be/QDS1Rt12ymA)


So what do you think? 

Can the Lions do it again? 

Or can Dangerfield, Atkins, Holmes and Smith maintain composure and keep themselves in the contest long enough to keep with the Pride of Brisbane Town."

Notable Brownlow favourites and their overall 2025 contested possession count:

- Rowell (3rd)

- Daicos (22nd)

- Baz (31st)

Finally, in the Round 20 matchup between Demons and Saints, the contested possessions rankings on that day were:

- Viney (1st, with 15 contested possessions)

- NWM (tied 6th, with 9 contested possessions)

I'm forced to conclude that AFL umpires are simply very attracted to CP. "
