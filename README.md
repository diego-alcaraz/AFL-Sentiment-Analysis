Integrating Social Media and Match Data for AFL Fan Sentiment Analysis

Aim: 
To analyze how fans of Australian Rules Football respond after matches through their opinions on social media, and to explore how these reactions relate to actual game outcomes. By combining match results with social media feedback, the project seeks to uncover links between on-field performance and the collective mood of supporters, offering insights that can help clubs, sponsors, and the wider AFL community strengthen fan engagement.
