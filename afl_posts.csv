I'm fortunate enough to have just secured a ticket for myself + companion/carer to this Saturday's prelim.

But I'm wondering if anyone, particularly wheelchair users, have any advice for getting to the prelim this Saturday. In the past I've always booked accessible parking tickets at the nearby Yarra Park which are reserved at $10 for those with accessible parking permits.

Even last year's Hawks vs Bulldogs final, which had a 98K crowd, I was able to reserve one of these car spaces without issue. But for this prelim they are fully booked out, so I'm becoming a bit stressed on how to get to the game.

Just wondering if anyone has any advice for getting to/from the game in a wheelchair, nearby private (accessible sized) parking, etc?"

(Note: Brisbane includes Bears + Lions; Sydney includes South Melb + Sydney Swans.)

* Collingwood have played the most, won the most and lost the most Finals.
* Only six clubs have winning records: Brisbane, Hawthorn, Richmond, Melbourne, Fitzroy and Essendon
* The Dees have won 54 Finals - 31 of those wins were between 1925 and 1964, five of those wins from 2007 to now.
* Fitzroy won 34 Finals - the first 30 wins came between 1898 and 1952, the last four came between 1979 and 1986. (They 'merged' with Brisbane in 1997.)
* Richmond won two Finals between 1983 and 2016 (34 seasons); Footscray won one Final between 1960 and 1991 (32 seasons); St Kilda did not win *any* Finals between 1974 and 1991 (18 seasons).
* North Melb have won five Finals from 2001 to 2025; Carlton have won four from 2002 to 2025; Essendon *zero* from 2005 to 2025.

There have been (and probably will only ever be) **eight drawn Finals**:

**1928 SF** \- Coll vs Melb (Coll won replay by 4)  
**1946 SF** \- Ess vs Coll (Ess by 19)  
**1948 GF** \- Melb vs Ess (Melb by 39)  
**1962 PF** \- Geel vs Carl (Carl by 5)  
**1972 SF** \- Carl vs Rich (Rich by 41)  
**1977 GF** \- Coll vs Nth (Nth by 27)  
**1990 QF** \- Coll vs WC (Coll by 59)  
**2010 GF** \- Coll vs St K (Coll by 56)

1ni88s6,"Would you follow a more in depth AFL stats/visuals page (charts, player impact, shot maps, player comparisons, historical trends etc)?",No_Wallaby7397,52,14,1757998005.0,2025-09-16T04:46:45+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1ni88s6/would_you_follow_a_more_in_depth_afl_statsvisuals/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1ni88s6/would_you_follow_a_more_in_depth_afl_statsvisuals/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"I know stats pages in sport aren’t new in AFL you’ve got things like Cench Footy etc, and overseas (especially in soccer) there’s a whole wave of analysis visuals built around things like expected goals, passing networks, player comparison radars, shot maps etc.

The difference is: in soccer these visuals have become a really valuable part of how fans, analysts, and even players talk about the game e.g. the fanalyst types. In AFL, most of what’s around right now is either text heavy or pretty surface level and there isn’t much that pulls together clean, in depth, easy-to-read visuals people can use week to week.

I was thinking of starting a dedicated Instagram/Twitter that focuses on AFL stats in that style, with things like:
- Shot maps (goals/behinds by location)
- Expected score models & scoring efficiency
- Player impact beyond disposals (inside-50s, pressure acts, meters gained)
- Team pressure/territory heatmaps
- Clear player vs player comparison graphics
- Historical/nostalgia stats presented visually

There are already some smaller accounts doing parts of this (AFL Insights, Wheeloratings, Matter of Stats, etc.), but I haven’t seen it packaged into a consistently visual, “Opta style” feed for AFL fans.

Would this be something you’d follow or find useful if it popped up in your feed?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. Hard to know where to engage with AFL fans!

1nhpx29,Historical list of all trades of top 10 picks for players aged 30 or over,FirstTimePlayer,36,17,1757952157.0,2025-09-15T16:02:37+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nhpx29/historical_list_of_all_trades_of_top_10_picks_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nhpx29/historical_list_of_all_trades_of_top_10_picks_for/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"With all the talk of Essendon & Hawthorn trading a top 10 pick plus multiple other assets for Zach Merrett, I thought it would be interesting to see what other 30 year olds have traded for top 10 picks.

After a bit of digging, here is a complete list of top 10 picks traded for players 30 and over since the beginning of the draft.

Trade	|	Team A	|	Team B	
---	|	---	|	---	
304: 2002 Trade for Wayne Carey	|	Adelaide received: Carey (Age 31) (28 games)	|	North Melbourne received: #2 (Wells - 258 games) + #18 (Shore - 0 games)	

Source: https://www.draftguru.com.au/ Note that there was some manual processing of data and it's possible I missed one or two, so any corrections welcome. Note numerous trades on the website are not numbered sequentially, and accordingly several are numbered out of order. Very occasionally, some complex trades have also been lodged with the AFL as a series of separate trades, so it's also possible something slipped through the gaps that way. Finally, this has focused on trades where the player is the key component. I have ignored trades which have fundamentally been pick shuffles and/or trades where there has been substantial additional material coming back the other way (Eg Pick 10 for Picks 20+21+Player)

For interests sake, I also made a note of any top 10 pick traded for players approaching 30, and came up with the following list:

Trade	|	Team A	|	Team B

Then theres the dining room ballot which surely theres a way to improve your chances here due to group size and seat limits. More members on a table increase your chances? Which table size most likely to get you a table?"

Today we sit just 2 ½ years (912 days) from the opening siren of the Tasmania Devils first ever AFL game and we can already feel the excitement around the Club, but the reality is there is still so much to do and that clock is ticking.

I can assure you that the Club’s Board have never thought that we had more time to establish the Club than we required, we knew we would have to work feverishly with all of the required stakeholders to be ready for 2028. I must say though, I am proud and excited about the progress that we have made so far as a Club.

Our entry to the AFL and to be playing in 2028 will require the Club's Training and Administration facility and the Macquarie Point Stadium to be underway before the end of 2025. One thing is for certain and that is that we are at a critical moment in time for our Club.

We recently conducted research across the Tasmanian community to better understand the views and understanding of our Club and the infrastructure required to support us, we did this because it is in our DNA to listen and learn from our community. There has been much data and discussion on the Macquarie Point Stadium particularly, but we felt there was a lack of clear and current data to really understand where our community were at with their opinions and understanding of the project.

The research has made clear that our Club needs to work together with key stakeholders to ensure that relevant information relating to the Stadium is made more available to Tasmanians. We are confident that there are answers to all these questions, many of which were answered during the recent Tasmanian Planning Commission hearings.

As we have found from day one the best path forward for our Club is by engaging with the Tasmanian people.

This latest research has provided us with insights that should be very helpful to all those stakeholders that have, along with us, the responsibility to deliver something special and generational for our state.

There is a tremendous opportunity to bring the Tasmanian community on this journey and genuinely make sure that this investment is one that benefits the entire State.

By listening to our community, we are better placed to work together to create great outcomes. We were really enthused by what we heard.

But now with the latest announcement made by the AFL, I thought it would be the right time to make it.

With the latest announcement of the State of Origin making an official return in the 2026 season, with Victoria vs Western Australia in Perth during the Pre Season on the 14th February, this would mark 27 years after the original concept was abolished. Apart from a couple of one off matches during the year. With the 2008 Hall of Fame match & the 2020 Bushfire Appeal match.

As much it should be a welcoming prospect for State of Origin returning to the fold. I feel its not quite enough to fix the problem of the pre season scheduling.

Last year after the official season started, there were a large number of soft tissue injuries to players due to not enough pre season games for the players to come into the home & away in the best playing condition. So lets be honest, players need more time and situations to be match ready for an upcoming season.

So I spend a few years brainstorming a whole bunch of ideas on what the AFL could do to create interest and more opportunity for players to get more game time. And I'll present some ideas right here.

Week 1: State of Origin: Two games with Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia & an Allies team (NSW, QLD, Tas, ACT, NT). A vs B, C vs D. The two winning teams then go into a playoff the following week

All Stars Indigenous Game: With the success of the revival of this game last season, the AFL should give it another run. Its will be a team of All Stars vs an official AFL team.

AFL International Challenge: This one might be a bit of a crazy idea, but this is a nod back to the old international matches that were played abroad, over the years the league had games in England, New Zealand, America, Canada etc and the last one was in London 2012 with Port Adelaide vs the Western Bulldogs. But this one is a special challenge game, feature the reigning premiers vs the reigning minor premier/ or if the premier holds both titles at the time, then the Grand Final runner up will be the opponent. Sort of like the FA Community Shield game (Premier League winner vs FA Cup winner), Rugby League's World Club Challenge (NRL Premier vs Super League Champions) or the UEFA Super Cup (UEFA Champions League winner vs Europa League winner). Its one that could to help grow the game abroad.

Week 2 to 4: State of Origin Final: The two winners of the first State of Origin Round go head to head in the final to crown the State of Origin Champions

AFL Community Series Challenge Cup: For the last 12 years, we had nothing but practice matches with nothing at stake since the old night series/pre season cup was abolished, I'm a bit of an old school fan who grew up in the era of pre season cups. So I thought maybe, the league should turn the match sims/practice matches into a mini tournament. But with this concept its not like the old knockout cup format where it ran for four weeks before the main season. In this concept, its run over about 2 to 3 weeks. Each club plays either 2 or 3 games against a random opponent. In this concept, a team gets 4 points for a win, 2 for a draw, percentage and bonus points for the margin that it wins by. 1 point for a 25 point and over, 2 points for a 50 point and over & 3 points for a 75 point and over. 

I did an experiment & research over the last two years with previous pre season ladders from 2014-2020 with the same setup and here are the results on who would be the winner of the series each year:

\* 2014: Hawthorn, \* 2015: Brisbane Lions, \* 2016: Fremantle, \* 2017: St Kilda, \* 2018: Richmond,  

\* 2019: West Coast, \* 2020: GWS

I must stress this, they'll be a group of people that will disagree with some of these ideas here. And that's fine, as footy fans we were entitled to opinion, just like my post here. But in this idea, team don't have to use their best players for most of the series, they could use the concept to test out new players who've been drafted, use fringe players that don't normally get a game in the main season and use it to trail tactics and formulate strategy in a competitive environment, and plus all use it to create winning culture should they win. 

I thank everyone who has taken the time out to read this post, understand it a bit of a lengthy one, but hopefully maybe some of these ideas might be taken on board, or maybe not. "

This will absolve you of any blame or ickiness in choosing one of the remaining teams - you can simply blame this.

I've just created a well established rule for AFL fans, that when you defeat a team you essentially conquer them and their fanbase, who are then obligated to support their new overlords until subsequent conquests.

Under this system, if your side didn't make the 8, your initial allegiances lie with the last Top 8 team who beat your team.

This means that fans of teams eliminated have had their support transferred as per the following:


ADE - HAW  
  CAR - GCS - BRI  
  ESS - GCS - BRI  
  FRE - GCS - BRI  
  GCS - BRI  
  GWS - HAW  
  MEL - COL  
  NOR - ADE - HAW  
  POR - FRE - GCS - BRI  
  RIC - GEE  
  STK - GWS - HAW  
  SYD - GEE  
  WBD - FRE - GCS - BRI  
  WCE - ADE - HAW  

  
This means that the remaining 4 sides have the following fanbases in addition to their own:


Brisbane:
CAR
ESS
FRE
GCS
POR
WBD


Collingwood:
MEL


Geelong:
RIC
SYD


Hawthorn:
ADE
GWS
NOR

So we obviously have the Ladder and the GF decides who finishes 1st/2nd. 

With Adelaide going out from 1st, I’m fairly sure they’re now recognised as 5th. Not sure if it’s actually official. 

My question is does ladder position determine that or is it the week you’re eliminated. Example Geelong finished 3rd last year and beat 2nd ranked PA. Both teams were eliminated in the preliminary final. 

So does PA finish 3rd because they went in higher ranked? Or are they 4th and Geelong 3rd because they beat PA in the QF. "

However, it did not take me and my girlfriend collectively long to establish a dislike towards her ability to interact with cohosts and players. I have not seen much of her since those days, I somewhat established her lack of presence and engagement with ANYONE sort of spoke for itself and she was gradually extinguished from that role.
Yes, I have known she has had other hosting roles within networks and I cannot comment on the quality of this as I have not seen it. ... BUT ….. my god. She talks over other presenters. She speaks louder than others to try and attain a dominant voice within the interview. She asks the absolute worst unscripted questions to the players. She buts in when the player is mid sentence. She runs with a joke that she herself laughs at and 99 times of 100 it is just not funny - and it's just unmitigated cringe on so many levels on the players behalf and the fellow presenters. The other presenters have to sort of look at each other and try and work out a way to rectify the conversation- and they obviously do, and make it work.
But boy oh boy, wow wee, how does this lady get a job when she adds absolutely nothing at all. I feel it's unnecessary to compare her to other female journalists/ presenters in the industry because it is on a complete and utter, unprecedented different level than what Rebecca is on. Sorry, just a rant. And a long term observation on this obnoxious being. Another reason Foxtel commentary wins on so many facets."

Now that it’s removed or reduced will it begin to happen, while considering that clubs want to keep good relations with each other. If a club like west coast, Richmond or Essendon want to get the best prospect for their club available, should they bid on players like Uwland, Patterson and Annabelle, e.g making it impossible to get Paterson if west coast go for him pick 2 after a Uwland bid occurs at 1."

A disgrace of a team, with a disgrace for a coach in Barry Cable.

Other than that, the Pineapple Grapple Final was a landslide after Quarter Time, with the big brother Chardonnay sipping Brisbane defeating the Rose Suns, and 9 goals to 2 after the first quarter will get that done, as the last quarter was just classic Brisbehinds, but thankfully for David Swallow after 249 games, he'll always have the 6th of September, 2025.

Which means next week we have one of the greatest Prelim Final lineups in living memory - Geelong and Hawthorn on Friday night, and Collingwood and Brisbane on Saturday evening.

**Without doubt, ttwo of the greatest hate watches in /r/AFL history.**

--------

In the first final between 1st and 8th since 2006, Hawthorn went to Adelaide for a knockout Semi Final for the second year running, but this year was different as the Hawks kicked 3 goals in the opening 3 minutes to smash the parochial crowd early in the piece, and that set the tone for the night...

With the strange feeling of having neutrals supporting them, the Hawks went on to lead at every change, and ultimately led by  Jack Gunston's 5 goals (4 of them after half time), Jai 'Duke' Newcombe being best afield, a backline that shut down Adelaide's talls and several other weirdos like Nick Watson, the Hawks won by 34 points, joining 2015 North Melbourne as the only 8th-placed teams to make a Preliminary Final, and they set up a Friday night Preliminary Final against their dear old rivals Geelong, and oddly enough, it's the first time since their inaugural VFL season in 1925 that they've won on September 12.

Bloody hell, imagine if they'd had Zach Merrett available.

The first time in 42 years that a minor premier has been knocked out in straight sets, the first time 8th has defeated 1st in a Final, and the first time a team has departed the finals after playing 2 finals and losing all 8 quarters.

Fucking hell, that is a **LOL of the Year Top 3, right there.**

And poor old Alex Neal-Bullen, leaves Melbourne for Adelaide after a double straight setting in 2022-23.... and suffers another straight sets exit.

**On another note, I'd like to say credit to /u/Razzle_Dazzle08 for winning the race to [post one of the funniest comments I've seen in my time on /r/afl](https://preview.redd.it/kz4suwdr7qof1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=486dae3d86ff8628d91b59755ac87fb99118211e)... bravo.**

The Pineapple Grapple promised the Earth but ultimately delivered Queensland as the Lions, despite their key injuries, matched the Suns in the 1st Quarter, then smoked the younger brother in a dominant 2nd Quarter with 6 goals to 2, then another 3 goals to zip in the 3rd Quarter had the game done to a dinner at 3/4 time, and the last quarter was simply Channel 7 trying to fill air time thanks to the Lions peppering the goals, and they got their angle when Josh Dunkley broke the record for the most tackles in a final (17), breaking a record that Jimmy Bartel had set with 16 in the 2009 Grand Final.

There would be no magical Sunny to end 2025, as the Lions were far too good and won by 53 points, which could easily have been greater were it not for a mild case of Brisbehinds in the last quarter, and the Premiership defence is still alive now that they've removed the deadwood of Lachie Neale, and it's on to Saturday at the MCG against the almighty challenge of facing Collingwood in front of 96,000+ Pies fans.

**And thus, the last inaugural Gold Coast Sun departed the Glitter Strip... farewell David Swallow, your watch is at an end.**

**LOL of the Week**

-----

Easy candidate this week, and one that will feature in the grand reveal in a few weeks...

**ADELAIDE, for their grand set of:**

- Straight setting as minor premiers for the first time since Thriller was No.1 on the charts

- Becoming the first minor premier to lose to the 8th placed team in a final

- Not even winning any of the 8 quarters they played in said home finals

- Focusing more on defending Izak Rankine than your own defensive 50 in a final

Outstanding work, and they now stand a chance of becoming the first team to go from 15th to LOL of the Year.

**And on to /u/Jawdanc for his SMH of the week... although you'll have to speak up, he's wearing a towel.**"

An uncontested mark is pretty clear, but I'm confused about touched v untouched marks. Sometimes a player will kick the ball, and in the air the ump shouts 'touched' and it's not a mark. 

But what about when the ball gets to the intended player and it's a contested mark, but the opposition taps it before the other player marks it and it's called a mark. This happens sometimes when it's kicked into a pack and a bunch go up for it.

Some are more obvious than others and I'm a bit too lazy to grab an example, but it's always confused me what the definition of touched when it comes to marks is. "

I dont really care either way wheter he stays or goes, but i do kinda think there needs to be some kinda overhaul with contracts these days and give more power to the clubs.

Im guessing essendon are kinda forced now to trade him to get value,  as if he sticks around, it'll just set them back further as he clearly doesn't want to be there.  So, either way, they lose I feel. 

Maybe something like if you break a contract or something,  you have to accept 25% less than what you were on unless both parties agree or something....I get that players personal situations can change, but that seems like a rare occurrence these days...

Merret when signed, would have had a pretty good idea where the club is at and the direction they sold to him. If he wasn't so sure, dont sign long term. Same goes with petraca and Oliver. 

Kinda feel for essendon atm, (and I love to hang shit on them, as they are probably my least favourite team) but something needs to change.

And the thought occurred, has there been any football club in Australian Rules Football at any level to win a senior premiership in 4 different leagues. So I did some research, and I looked really hard for the answer, but no success.

Over the course of 64 years of the Southport Football Club, they have competed in 4 leagues. And in 3 of them they've won the senior premiership. Between 1961-1980 the club were the Gold Coast Australian Football League (GCAFL) premiers 8 times, in the Queensland Australian Football League (QAFL) the club were premiers 13 times between 1983-2008, and also won the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL) premiership in 2018.

Now in the Victorian Football League after the NEAFL was merged into the VFL in 2020, now it is 3rd Grand Final, could the Southport Football Club do something that probably has never been done before, and that's become the Grand Slam Champions of Australian Rules Football by winning at least a premiership in 4 different leagues.

Crows finish on top and go out in straight sets. They've missed a good opportunity to make at least a prelim and Nicks has been outcoached by two slightly less experienced coaches. 

Dogs finished 9th after a season when they genuinely looked like premiership favourites one week, and cellar dwellars the next. I think to a player Dogs were better than at least 3, if not 4 of the eventual top 8, but just couldn't get the consistency they needed.

In fact, let me add to it by illustrating the quality of this 8th placed team.  

This year they actually won 1 more game than last year and finished with a higher percentage, but finished 1 place lower.  

2024 - 14 wins, 9 losses, 56 PP, 118.5% - 7th  
2025 - 15 wins, 8 losses, 60 PP, 120.9% - 8th  

If they finished with the same results this year but in 2024 they would have placed 3rd instead of Geelong (and still played Power in SA in a QF).  

The ladder was so tight for the top 9 teams this year that small results mattered more than ever. It seems that the final results don’t reflect the true ability of all the teams based on a simply 1-8 ranking. After all, Suns were only 1 game away from top 4. Instead Collingwood are into a prelim instead of playing Hawks in an elimination final at the MCG, where the Hawks have played well against them in the last few years.  

Footy is a funny old thing but it seems like one of the tightest races in my living memory. "

I am writing to you all today following the conclusion of our 2025 AFL Season and to address the recent industry speculation that surrounds our club.
 
I understand this has been a source of frustration and anxiety for many of you. As President, I want to be as clear and direct as possible.
 
2025 has been a very tough year. Tough on everyone connected to Essendon - members, supporters, from the injured players to our older players, the young blokes coming through, our coaches, our administration, everyone.
 
Tough on everyone to go to the footy knowing we were missing so many of our best players through injury, which made it hard to win.
 
To all our fans and members, thank you for your support; we couldn’t have gotten through this without you. There are no tougher or more committed supporters in the league than us. We are very grateful.
 
Let me be clear. Zach Merrett is contracted to our football club and our position is clear, he is not for trade.  
 
Zach has been an outstanding player for Essendon over a long period and will go down in history as one of our best ever players. We are committed to him, and we expect his commitment to our club to continue. 
 
This club, with its proud 153-year history, is bigger than any single player, coach, or administrator. While champions have come and gone, the club has always endured and that will continue for the next 153 years. No one is bigger than the club.
 
Jordan Ridley is contracted and is not for trade. We acknowledge his frustration in recent years with his body – we share these frustrations. We’ve now made fundamental changes to our high performance and medical team as we strive to provide our players with a world-class High-Performance Program and Team, led by Mathew Inness – I will touch on this further below. 
 
Whilst understanding the AFL’s Free Agency system, we are still very disappointed to lose Sam Draper. We are incredibly proud of the work the club put in to help him become the player he is today, taking him on as a rookie with minimal football experience, training and supporting him through a knee reconstruction before he had even played a game. We wish Sam all the best.
 
Our club is being led by two outstanding individuals in Brad Scott and Craig Vozzo.  They are determined men, who will lead this club to the success we all desire.  We are lucky to have them both, and we will give them all the support and help they need to make us successful again. I ask you to do the same.
 
To address the immense challenges we faced with player availability, we are very excited with the recent appointments we have made in our high-performance department with Mathew Inness and David Regan. They are both outstanding professionals who are very highly regarded in their areas of expertise. We are confident that they will over time, transform this critical area of our club, so as to provide our players with the very best programs and environment for success.
 
We are delighted with the ongoing hard work of our List and Recruiting Team led by Matt Rosa. Their strategy, insight, and decisiveness in the 2024 Player Movement Period, has set us up for an exciting Exchange and Draft period, where we can bring in a substantial amount of young talent. We currently have at least four picks under 25, to take maximum advantage of the draftable talent available this year. We wish the Team well as they approach their Finals period of October and November.  
 
We will continue to make changes to our list, be aggressive and uncompromising, to bring in the best available talent to our club. 
 
We are objecting in the strongest possible way to any potential removal of the Father Son rule.  We are doing this at an administration and AFL Commission level. In our view, removing this rule goes against the spirit of this game. Great sports like the AFL, don’t take away elements that are truly unique, like this longstanding rule. We understand the need for a review of the DVI system that sits behind the AFL Draft and each of the Northern and NGA Academies, and Father Son Rule, so as to better achieve fair value payment under each mechanism.

To all those members that have shown enormous grace and courage under pressure to contact either myself, Craig Vozzo or Brad Scott with positive messages of support, THANK YOU!  This is a tough time for everyone, but a poor us attitude, it’s not fair attitude, will just hold us back.  
 
We have together, all of us, done so much hard work to invest and improve all areas of the club over the past three years. We now have a foundation for growth, a platform to build for sustained long term success.
 
Our AFLW team is flying. I urge everyone to get behind them, they are an outstanding group of players, closely bonded by a terrific coaching and admin staff led by Aysha Ward and Natalie Wood. I encourage everyone to get out to Windy Hill and watch them play, it is a great day out and you will really enjoy getting back to Windy Hill where we all have such great memories.
 
Thank you for reading all of this, but it is important that I try and keep you up to date with what is going on, without at the same time bombarding you with constant messages.
 
After a tough year, I look forward to the draft, to see who the next stars of the Essendon Football Club will be, as well as an exciting AFLW season ending in finals wins.
 
Our commitment remains. To build a club that you can all be proud of, one that is built on a foundation of stability and clear direction. I can assure you that the board, our executive team, and our coaching staff, led by Brad Scott, are completely aligned on this vision. Every decision we make is deliberate and in the best interests of the club's long-term future.
 
Thank you for your ongoing support. 
 
Your belief in our club is what drives us, and we are working tirelessly to build a team that will deliver the success you deserve.
 
Go Bombers
 
Dave

But beyond the specifics of his case, it raises a bigger question about the AFL’s approach to player movement - especially when it comes to trading players who are still under contract.

With clubs now able to trade future picks and build more sophisticated list strategies, it’s worth asking: why are players still able to dictate their destination, even when they’re under contract?

Essendon could go and find the best deal that benefits their club without being limited to dealing with a single suitor.

In most global sports leagues like the NBA contracts don’t guarantee a player stays put. They guarantee pay and terms, but clubs retain the right to trade players as part of their strategic planning. It’s not personal, it’s professional. And it works.

So, is it time the AFLPA rebalance the power dynamic?

Here’s what could change:

If a player is under contract, the club should have the flexibility to explore trade options without needing player consent. This would allow teams to manage their lists more effectively and respond to changing needs.

Players have gained significant control over movement in recent years. That’s a good thing, but it’s also tilted heavily toward individual preference. A more balanced model would still protect player welfare while giving clubs more agency."

For the second year running, Hawthorn wind up playing a Semi Final on a Friday night in Adelaide, this time facing the Crom in what is apparently the closest 1st vs 8th final on paper in recorded history, although will probably end up like all the other 1st vs 8th finals...

**AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WE'VE GOT THE PINEAPPLE GRAPPLE, MANGO TANGO FINAL WE ALL LONGED FOR.**

Fancy that, Queensland got a Lions-Suns Final before the Olympic Games arrived... who'd have thought that!

-------

**Adelaide [](/adelaide2) vs Hawthorn [](/hawthorn2) - Adelaide Oval, 7:10pm ACST**

-----

The fifth final between Adelaide and Hawthorn (1993 EF, 2007 EF, 2012 PF, 2015 SF), with Hawthorn leading 3-1, however this is the first final in Adelaide between the teams.

The Hawks will also become Adelaide's most common finals matchup, surpassing a tie with West Coast and Collingwood on 4.

Adelaide's maiden final was an Elimination Final against Hawthorn in 1993, with the Crows winning by 15 points - It was their only Finals win under Graham Cornes.

There's 3 Crows survivors from the 2015 Semi Final against the Hawks that will play on Friday - Rory Laird, Brodie Smith and Taylor Walker, while Hawk Jack Gunston missed the game due an ankle injury in the Qualifying Final. 

This is the 11th final between 1st and 8th on the ladder, and the first since 2006 (West Coast vs Western Bulldogs) - In all, 1st is 10-0 vs 8th, winning all 6 games in Week One under the McIntyre Final Eight system (1994-99), plus 4 Semi Finals in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006.

The closest any 8th-placed team has come to defeating 1st was the maiden 1st vs 8th final in 1994, when Collingwood (8th) lost to West Coast (1st) by 2 points at the WACA, as [Mick McGuane dropped an uncontested mark with 5 seconds left](https://youtu.be/SEtX3KL2Pxc?si=QEoMGObRRmJMvmkV&t=471)... the Magpies didn't play in another final for 8 years, and the Eagles won the flag.

The Crows' Showdown Final win ([Which was 20 years ago on Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-2O5l_ZwmM&pp=ygUTc2hvd2Rvd24gZmluYWwgMjAwNQ%3D%3D)) is their only appearance in a 1st vs 8th Final, while the Hawks' only appearance in a 1st vs 8th Final was in 1996, when they lost to the Sydney Swans by 6 points at the SCG.

The Crows have never lost a Semi Final when they've finished in the Top 4 - 1997 (4th, defeated Geelong), 2002 (3rd, defeated Melbourne), 2005 (1st, defeated Port Adelaide) and 2012 (2nd, defeated Fremantle).

The last minor premier to suffer a straight set exit was North Melbourne in 1983, who lost to Hawthorn in the 2nd Semi Final, then lost the Preliminary Final against Essendon.

The only 8th-placed team to ever make a Preliminary Final is North Melbourne in 2015... sadly for North, their Semi Final win against the Swans is still their most recent win in a Final.

Also one final one - The Crows are 2-2 in Finals played on September 12 (They won in 2015 and 1998, lost in 2009 and 2003), while the Hawks last played a game on September 12 in 1987 (Lost to Carlton in a Semi Final), and their last win on September 12 was back in their inaugural VFL/AFL season in 1925 (Defeated North Melbourne).

-------

**Brisbane Lions [](/brisbane) vs Gold Coast [](/goldcoast2) - The Gabba, 7:35pm AEST**

------

In the Gold Coast's maiden finals series we get the historic event of a Pineapple Grapple/Mango Tango Final, which means we've had a Pineapple Grapple (2025), Showdown (2005) and Sydney Derby (2016, 2018, 2021 & 2024) final before a Western Derby Final, despite the Derby pre-dating all of them.

As of last weekend, both clubs sit 1-2 for all-time winning percentage in Finals - The Suns are at a perfect 100% (1/1), and the Lions are at 63.16% (24/38)

The Suns are the only team in league history to win their maiden final by 1 point, and they joined the select group of teams to win on their finals debut - Collingwood (1897), Essendon (1897), Fitzroy (1898), Hawthorn (1957), Adelaide (1993) and GWS (2016)

The Lions are seeking to avoid the infamous club of reigning premiers that have gone out in straight sets under the current Top 8 format - 2007 West Coast, 2016 Hawthorn and 2022 Melbourne, who themselves were knocked out by the Lions.

Also, 1995 West Coast finished 5th under the old McIntyre System and went out in straight sets.

The Lions are also seeking to avoid becoming the first club to suffer 3 straight sets exits under the current Top 8 system, with the Lions (2019 & 2021) level with Hawthorn (2016 & 2018), Port Adelaide (2001 & 2023) and Melbourne (2022 & 2023) on 2.

Also, this will be only the second time in Brisbane's history that they've played a game on September 13... the only time was when they played Sydney in Cairns in what was deemed Round 17 of 2020, with the Lions winning by 32 points.

Finally, the Suns have only won at the Gabba 3 times from 21 attempts in their history, all of them coming against the Lions - The inaugural Pineapple Grapple in Round 7 2011, Round 19 2015, and Round 5 2018. 

That win was so long ago that Steven May, Tom Lynch and Jack Bowes, plus Sam Day who will line up for the Lions on Saturday night, were all playing for the Suns. 

------

**Where have all the milestones gone**

------

100 consecutive games for Blake Hardwick [](/hawthorn2), fifth Hawthorn player to play 100 consecutive games (Andy Collins 189, Michael Tuck 138, Kelvin Moore 128, Shaun Burgoyne 107)

And the only other two are 150 games for Sean Lemmens, who won't even play, and 50 games for Malcolm Rosas, who won't even play."

The last time was in 2019 when third ranked Richmond effectively switched places with minor premier Geelong.

Other times this occurred:
- 2016: Geelong (2) v Sydney (1)
- 2006: Adelaide (2) v West Coast (1)/Sydney (4) v Fremantle (3)
- 2005: West Coast (2) vs Adelaide (1)/St Kilda (4) v Sydney (3)
- 2003: Collingwood (2) v Port Adelaide (1)/Sydney (4) v Brisbane (3)
- 2002: Brisbane (2) v Port Adelaide (1)/Collingwood (4) v Adelaide (3)

This also happened various times in the weird Macintyre system of the ‘90s which allowed a team to finish outside the top four and host a semi final.

Microsoft Co-Pilot says the same thing. Bah.

For starters, Pendles has played 424 games over 20 seasons, so he should be on the list above KB.

More importantly, according to AFL Tables, Dustin Fletcher played every season from 1993 to 2015, which makes 23 in total. It's possible someone has played more seasons, though, with a lower number of games in total?

PS: At 40y 23d in his 400th and last game, Fletch is the **2nd oldest player** to ever take the field. The record is 43y 50d for Vic Cumberland in 1920 for St Kilda - he played in 1898-1901 (Dees), 1903-04, 1907-08, 1912-1915, 1920 (Saints). In between, he played for Sturt in the SANFL for 1909-11."

Wildcard Round has been quite the topic of debate.

With the Wildcard Round in affect in the VFL since it has 21 teams currently, scheduled to increase to 23, but now the AFL have been between either introducing the concept to the big game. So this would see clubs between 7th & 10th place duke it out for the final two spots in the finals. 7th vs 10th & 8th vs 9th. I get why the AFL are thinking about this concept and putting it into place, but why add it in went you have only 18 teams in the competition. I'm an old school fan where every season, you have within 24 rounds in a home & away season to bank as many victories to climb the ladder and become a contender in the final 8. Ideally maybe when the league grows to 20 clubs after when Tasmania comes in and the 20th wherever that maybe. But for the time being, final 8 within 24 rounds is where it should be."

1nce5xo,Can someone bust or confirm these AFL myths I keep hearing about?,Blowdogs,73,56,1757409760.0,2025-09-09T09:22:40+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nce5xo/can_someone_bust_or_confirm_these_afl_myths_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nce5xo/can_someone_bust_or_confirm_these_afl_myths_i/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"Myth 1: I've heard this a few times in the past and it came up again in the tradies podcast about the power of player agents in the game. The idea or myth is that agents are so powerful that they have some level of power over clubs and it generally goes along the lines of this ""let our player leave your club to the club he wants to go to or when XYZ player who is in our management stable comes up for free agency we won't let you have a seat at the table""

I don't understand how this could possibly work in real life, so if Zac Butters looks around and sees hawthorn doing well and thinks he would fit right into their midfield, talks to his agent and says suss out a deal here - the agent says ""sorry mate but they wouldn't play ball for XYZ player last year so we don't want to help them"" - Why wouldn't Butters say ""why the fuck do I care about the career of XYZ player from a rival club - get me to Hawthorn"". Genuinely don't understand how this would play out as it's talked about. 

Myth 2: ""You can make more money in the long run staying at Carlton or Collingwood for example"" heard this one plenty of times, recently from Eddie Maguire in relation to TDK. The idea being that these big clubs have big business networks that can set you up for life post football and that often by staying a one club player and ignoring a pay rise elsewhere its better for you. While I understand these networks exist, if another club is offering lets say $200k extra per year for 5 years how on earth is it possible that its better for you financially to forgo this, then wait 5 years and hopefully get a sweet gig somewhere at these places that not only make up for the past 5 years but also is better than what you could make at the destination clubs post football network.   
  
  
I refuse to believe these 2 myths but more than happy to be corrected here.  "

Which is fine, except that the current confusion is a direct result of the AFL changing the rule from “deliberate” to “insufficient intent”. 

The rule was fine previously. A defensive kick to the boundary was called a free kick when it was blatantly obvious. The AFL has taken this to another level this year, and in my opinion, has created the conditions for the rule change by varying the interpretation prior to the season to be much more harsh on out of bounds decisions. The entire approach from the AFL was to interpret the rule differently to lead to a situation where change was accepted and introduced. 

The issue this year is players are being pinged for things that aren’t insufficient intent, e.g a player grabs the ball from a pack, tries to kick, is tackled and swung as they kick, leading the ball to go toward the boundary rather than where they were aiming before the tackle”. That’s not insufficient intent. And the situations that are more deliberate, eg a player running the ball over the line rather than trying to keep it in aren’t called and my understanding is this won’t be called, as it’s not a kick or a handball over the line. 

So this is just another example of the AFL bringing in rules to combat issues in the game which occur directly from the AFL changing a previous rule. "

Once was the premier competition in Victoria before the VFL formed in 1897 currently the AFL as we know today. The second tier competition for the Victorian state level, with 21 clubs competing in it. 

Now here is where it gets interesting, 11 of those clubs are AFL reserves teams, 10 official VFL clubs with 2 of them with alignment deals with 2 AFL clubs. And 5 of those clubs in total are from New South Wales & Queensland. 

Going in the next season of 2026, the league have given the go ahead for two new AFL reserves teams in St Kilda & Tasmania, that will bring the total clubs to 23.

Now, how do you combat a league with 23 clubs competing in it. That number just seems too much for a league, let alone a state league to handle.

Do you bring back the NEAFL competition to serve as a mini conference competition, send Gold Coast, GWS, Sydney, Brisbane & Southport back there and invite former clubs who competed in the NEAFL previous to fill spots.

How about reintroduce the relegation/promotion system which was in effect in the old VFA between 1961-1988. Split the competition into two divisions where the last place Division 1 teams goes into a promotion relegation playoff with the Division 2 premiers.

Or how about you take all the AFL reserves teams and put them in a separate competition from the other VFL clubs. In a way it could serve as a catalyst to the future National AFL reserves competition that many others have been wanting for so long. Given that Melbourne & Hawthorn have deals with two VFL clubs in alignments, they'll be included with the other pure VFL clubs competition, but as since Hawthorn have a deal with Box Hill until 2026 & Melbourne signed an historic 30 year partnership with Casey with 15 years left to run, as soon as they decide to form their own reserves teams and join the AFL reserves comp.

One thing is for sure, one league in Australian rules cannot have 23 clubs in one season system alone. But we'll have to see how this pans out."

When it comes to the state derbies they have always been fascinating to watch depending on our you barrack for and what state you're from. Over the years its rare that the state rivals go head to head in the finals. The SA Showdown rivals Adelaide & Port Adelaide only done battle once in a finals in 2005, in the Sydney Derby, rivals GWS & the Sydney Swans faced off 4 times in finals. And as mentioned Q-Clash will have its first finals matchup.

But the other state rivalry surprisingly after so many years have never ever clashed in finals. That would be the Western Derby rivals West Coast & Fremantle. Now here where it get interesting. It almost happened twice in history. In 2006 & 2015. 

2006: West Coast were minor premiers & Fremantle finished 3rd. Both teams lost their Qualifying Finals matches, but both went to the preliminary final. West Coast won its prelim match and went to the Grand Final and won it, while Fremantle lucked out in its Prelim and were knocked out

2015: Similar scenario, Fremantle were minor premiers and West Coast finished 2nd place behind Fremantle. Both teams won the Qualifying Finals and went straight to the Prelim final. Fremantle were knocked out in the Prelim while West Coast went on to the Grand Final that year.

So when you look at it, it almost happened twice, an all Western Australian Grand Final on two occasions. But maybe somewhere in the future, we'll finally get to see that WA Derby finals clash, to add another chapter to the league's forgotten state rivalry?"

- Lack of strong competitors in the city, mostly due to it being a sporting graveyard, compared to having 4 League sides and soccer in the West of the town.

- A comparison between a culturally and statistically poor side still drawing a slightly higher crowd than a team that has consistently made finals.

- And Gold Coast being a decently strong footy city.

But what I would say that little extra bits of history have been made and some that could happen.

Prime Example from Week 1: As of now all 18 clubs current in the AFL have now competed in a Final Series and also all 18 clubs have won a Finals Series match, that was seen with Gold Coast not only competing in its first final but also winning it by beating Fremantle.

As we go to week 2 of the series and beyond, there could be potential moments that could go down. For example: The Adelaide Crows are the reigning minor premiers, they lost their Qualifying Final last week to Collingwood, now they must face Hawthorn in a Semi Final, should they lose to the Hawks, the Crows could become the first minor premiership club to go out in straight sets not only the first since 1983 but the first in the Final 8 system since it was introduced in 1994.

Hawthorn have a couple of historic feats staring at them, the first being potentially the lowest ranked top 8 to go all the way and win the premiership from 8th and second be the only club to win a premiership in 7 straight decades since the 60's.

Brisbane could become the only interstate club in history to win 5 premierships.

Gold Coast could become the first club to win a premiership in its first finals series, not since the inaugural season in 1897. 

Geelong just looking for its 11th premiership

And last but not least, Collingwood could make all history for all time records. Should Collingwood win, they'll be standing alone at the top of the mountain with the most VFL/AFL Premierships at 17.

Will we see extra history made and records set, wait and see. "

All the solutions he’s throwing out seem to be missing the most obvious fix: Not throwing the ball as high.

Part of the problem is that we give rucks time to set up and wrestle with each other because the umps are hell bent on launching the ball into the stratosphere. If we threw the ball up lower, rucks could just run, jump and connect with the ball at its highest point, rather than wrestling their opponent whilst waiting for the ball to be in reach.

Sometimes we see players try and jump at the ball, but they mistime it because it’s hard to jump up and hit a ball that’s falling downwards. Throwing it up lower eliminates that risk and rewards those who will run and jump at the footy.

I shall present two scenarios.
Firstly, Optus stadium goal to goal distance is 165m accounting for a 9m goal square the distance is 156m.
If you get take max speed of the fasted player at Freo from the game J. Treacy 32km/hr (8.88m/s). At this speed he would run 80m in 9 seconds needing to kick the ball the remaining 76m which is greater than the longest goal ever kicked (72.3m).
On the other hand, if you take the fastest speed recorded in the AFL Gary Rohan 37.8km/hr (10.5m/s). Could have run 94.5m leaving 61.5m for the kick making it possible.
Take note that the player gets more than a 9m plus run up to reach top speed before the clock starts.
This is also assuming the player runs in a straight line and bounces without losing top speed. I assume every one else just shepherds the player.
The other more realistic option is the player runs and kicks the ball 50 meters which travels at 25m/s taking 2s. This leaves the reaming time 7s for the player to run 61m (Treacy speed) or 73.5 (Rohan Speed) leaving 55m or 32.5m to goal.
 
So is it possible yes. Is it likely don’t know. I do maths, I do not play football.

My understanding the rationale is to reduce the possibility of a rematch of the QF teams and different matchups prior to the GF. 

However, because of the cross over, there is an argument that the team that finishes first will often get the “harder” Preliminary final because they will (generally) face a team that is either 2nd or 3rd while the winner of the opposite QF gets a team 4th (or lower).

I would propose keeping the teams on the same side of the bracket to increase the chances of 1st vs 2nd actually facing off in the Grand Final. Using this year as an example, Collingwood would host the winner of Adelaide/Hawthorn, which also plays more into the “second chance” element of it all. Fairly sure most other elimination style brackets in other sports keep the top seeds opposite sides of the draw to ensure the only way they can meet is in a (grand) final. 

Thoughts? Arguments for or against? It is a thought exercise I am not strongly advocating for, just making discussion. Ps. I am not a crackpot. 

Edit: 

Adding some examples 

In 2024, Port could have faced Geelong again in the prelim, and Brisbane played Sydney, might have ended up with Geelong/Brisbane being the GF instead. 

2023 unchanged as 1st and 2nd won through.

2022 is the interesting one where could have been a Geelong/Collingwood prelim, and then Sydney/Brisbane on the other side. No idea how that would have played out. "

If you're mad about it be better, you've had like 2 hours to beat me to this.

Starting on saturday afternoon with a pretty processional win by Narrm against Richmond with the Dees kicking the first 7 goals of the match.

Meanwhile Gold Coast got their mojo back with a strong win over the Giants, at one point bringing the lead out to 38 points before GWS pared it back to 19 with a few late goals.

Both Richmond and GWS remain winless but both have winnable games in the next couple of rounds.

\--

This was followed by two games which were incomprehensibly at the same time as men's finals:

Carlton v Bulldogs where the Bulldogs got the lead halfway through the second only for Carlton to kick back into gear and win by 16, the Bulldogs hounded by poor accuracy. Carlton looking very promising this year.

Then Hawthorn v Euro-Yroke in Cairns on saturday night had the Hawks break out to a comfortable lead late in the 2nd and never look back while the Saints looked like they might go goalless until there was about 10 minutes to go.

\--

Sunday started with an arm wrestle between Sydney and Walyalup before the Swans broke away late in the 4th to continue their perfect season, meanwhile the Dockers drop to 16th with only one win out of four. Both teams will be interesting to watch as Sydney are probably finals-material but not top four material and the Dockers do not look like a bottom 4 team.

Brisbane with a gutsy win against Kuwarna, with the Crows looking set with a 17 point lead going into the last only for Brisbane to kick 3 unanswered goals in the last to win by 3 points.

North with a very expected win over Collingwood but inaccuracy kept the margin to a comparatively low 45 points. The Pies breath a sigh of relief. North get ready for what should be their first big challenge of the season: Brisbane at Springfield Stadium.

Geelong led from the get-go against Essendon and went on to win by 31 after making a statement by dropping captain Meg McDonald last week. The Cats' first win of the season and Essendon's first loss.

Then rounding out the round was another comeback win from Waalitj Marawar against Yartapuulti with the Power leading by 3 goals in the 3rd only for the Eagles to comeback with 7 of the last 8 goals of the match. Eagles are looking very likely to make their first finals appearance, a welcome respite for long-suffering fans.

\--

LOL of the week is a no brainer. After harping on about attendance in the offseason the AFL puts two games at the same time as men's finals. Weird and bad. Thankfully it appears they've avoided this for every other week, including giving Grand Final Day clear air with no W games that day."

Freo went way too defensive in the last few mins. When they were up by a goal, which was an amazing comeback, btw, they decided to go back deep in their def 50. Idk why they didn't attack here to ice the game. They had brayshsw free, arms up, in the middle where they could've chained it and brought another inside 50. I mean, they literally just did that to be a goal up. Was such an open and essy target. Instead, it goes back to Ryan, who kicks long down the line and gets intercepted and goal by the end of it by mac to level scores. Think the same person gave the free to swallow as well, forget his name 
Freo played their worst brand of footy at the worst possible time to show that slow freo does not work 
I'm not even a Freo fan but just pissed me off. They pinned themselves in a corner and went long down the line when they could've chained handball and got another chance at goal"

The problem is that he can't stand the commentators on the live tv coverage. His biggest complaint is that they're more interested in hyping the game than communicating what's happening on field (which isn't too surprising since people watching the tv can usually see what's happening for themselves).

I've suggested that he follows with the radio. Does anyone have any recommendations for radio stations that provide commentary that is clear, calm and relatively accessible for an old man who has otherwise given up on following the game, despite his team being in the finals?

Edit: Thanks for everyone who chipped in! Stoked to hear that the ABC is the best choice. Can't remember the last time I read a reddit post where the opinion was unanimous. Cheers all!"

I used to think Suns were a ""made up Club"" Born of commerce, and raised on draft picks, and AFL mothers milk. Not anymore.

It gave us insight into how many families have boys playing way from home, and how invested many Suns families may have been, through many hard years. But with this family, and I would suggest Noah Anderson's too, since they were drafted, together  there is a genuine, fair dinkum commitment to the Club, and that character clearly shines prismatically through Matt and Noah into the Suns culture.

Watching Matt, after delivering a game like that, step back from the interviewers, and let his Mum speak to the support he had received (How funny and genuine, when she gestured to his cut cheek ""Who did that!?""), and praise Dave Swallow, Mark Evans, and the other families for their support, made the moment even more special. 

Well done to Kath Loughnan, Nathan and Jordan, and Fox Footy production team, for allowing this moment to flow.

**Postscript:** After Matt, we had Touk Miller (also one who has stuck fat), issuing the challenge to send Lions out in straight sets, which brought it back to what we also love about the game: local rivalry, and no less a genuine moment!

Loved it!"

What I’m wondering is how many WA fans feel the same way I do in that when we’re not playing or knocked out I support West Coast when they’re playing, because I see it as WA vs everyone else rather than wanting them to fail out of support for my club. In 2018 I was definitely not going for Collingwood and I was disappointed when Fyfe said the opposite. That obviously goes out the window on derby day but why if I’m watching Sydney vs the eagles would I want Sydney to win when I’ve never been to Sydney and I don’t know if I even know anyone from there?

How many west coast fans feel the same in the other direction towards freo? Obviously you can’t go off social media comments and I’ve seen the “hate watch” comments but I don’t feel like that accurately represents the people out there"

I find it stupid that we reward a player for slipping into head high contact.

If anything this should be the equivalent of ducking. Players slip when trying to change directions to evade which you could probably call prior opportunity.

This is probably only in situations where the tackle and the slipping is simultaneously."

Anyway, I'm still trying to catch my breath after the Elimination Finals... what a fantastic day of Finals football, and that includes the VFL goal after the siren.

Now, on we go:

------

**Adelaide vs Collingwood**

In Adelaide's first final in 8 years, there were shades of the 2002 and 2005 Qualifying Finals, as a 4th-placed Collingwood team down on form went to Adelaide to take on the red hot minor premiers (2002), the Crows went in on a massive winning streak but lost a key player to suspension (Ricciuto in 2005 and Rankine this year)...

And the signs were there early as the finals experience of the Pies  shone through against the Crows' comparative lack of September experience, as Darcy Moore put in a captain's knock down back, while the Crom fans notably made dicks of themselves with the booing of Quaynor, achieving the impossible and having people wish Collingwood would win.

Then again, that kind of behaviours what happens when you live in a state that didn't accept convicts... a cavalcade of weirdos. 

Ultimately, the Pies blew the Crows away with a superb burst of 5 goals in 15 minutes to start the 3rd Quarter, pushing the margin out to 35 points, but the Crows got themselves back in it to trail by 19 points with a quarter to play, but thanks to a combination of Pies experience and some bad Crows decisions (Thilthorpe handballing instead of kicking at an open goal), the Pies ground out the clock and ultimately held the hosts goalless in the last quarter, winning by 24 points to jump straight into the Preliminary Final, after following Peter Daicos' advice... **Go fucking win.**

The Magpies are now 4-0 against the Crows in finals, Tex Walker's 300th game disappointment was sealed when his son wore a Nick Daicos guernsey next to him on his chairing off, and the Crom now face the Hawks for the right to get minced by Geelong in a Prelim Final.

------

**Geelong vs Brisbane**

For the fourth time in 5 years, Geelong and Brisbane met in a final, and for the first time it wasn't a Preliminary Final, and despite the Lions kicking the first goal, the Cats were dominant pretty much the entire night, so dominant in fact that even Oisin Mullin kicked a goal, and it was only some poor first half goalkicking that didn't see the game put away by half time...

That, and Cam Rayner milking a free kick 150m away from the ball to kick a goal, followed by getting another one seconds later, which was even more contentious than the original free kick.

I think that's the first time I've seen a double goal in a final since the West Coast-Carlton Semi Final in 2011... the Eagles won that game by 3 points.

Anyway, Cats fans were even more incensed by that than they were when the Pyramid collapsed, but the mood changed again when their team kept the foot firmly on the collective throat, breaking away to lead by 31 points at the last break, as even Tom Stewart joined the goalkickers list, and the Lions just never looked like overcoming that gap, with the Cats ultimately going on to win by a comfortable 38 points, also matching the all-time finals record of 13 individual goalkickers... only Ollie Dempsey (3) and Jeremy Cameron (2) were their multiple goalkickers.

A 14th Prelim in 19 years for Geelong, ensuring both Prelims will be at the MCG, while the Lions' premiership defense got that little step closer to impossible when it was confirmed Lachie Neale's comeback game would be his last in 2025, as he'd done his calf, joining the Lions' lengthy casualty ward, which is now so bad that Torn ACL was added to Eric Hipwood's problems.

------

**GWS vs Hawthorn**

After Aunty Joan Bell completed the longest recorded Welcome to Country in history to defeat Rob Oakeshott's record for the longest recorded speech in Australian history, the Giants and Hawks played a Final that was entertaining, thrilling, bat shit crazy, and often all three simultaneously. 

After the Giants dominated the opening 13 minutes without kicking a goal, the Hawks got the opening goal when nobody bothered to follow Jai Newcombe after a 50-metre penalty, and with the momentum the Hawks proceeded to slam on 7 goals in the opening quarter, maintaining that 4-5 goal lead for the 1st Half, which got even worse for the Giants when Darcy Jones tore his ACL.

Then the 2nd Half started much the same as the 1st Half did, as the Orange Tsunami and Hokball engaged in an epic clash of vibe football, with the first goal coming 15 minutes in via Jack Gunston, then Jack Ginnivan kicked his 3rd goal from 50 metres out to make it a game-high 42 points....

That's when this story got bat shit crazy.

With super sub Josh Kelly producing a quarter for the ages (14 disposals & 2 goals), the Giants kicked 6 unanswered goals in the last 15 minutes to whittle the lead down to a goal at 3/4 time, setting up a mega finish, then Hogan made it 7 unanswered goals to tie the scores, Jake Stringer kicked a point to put the Giants ahead by a point, which completed yet another massive GWS turnaround in 2025...

But that's when the Hawks fought back, as they reclaimed the lead with a few behinds, then Sam Butler got a HTB free kick and goaled to reclaim the lead, Chol then goaled from the next centre clearance to put the Hawks up by 13 points, then the Hawks defense put the clamps on and withstood the Giants' last desperate attacks, the game sealed when Jake Ricciardi hit the post with 90 seconds left, and Chol snapped the last goal to cap off an epic game, the Hawks winning by 19 points to end their Showgrounds curse.

A superb final that just about had the lot - The Hawks taking their chances in the 1st Half amidst the Giants' forward half barrage (72 Inside 50s to 56), the Giants producing a superb finals comeback that will sadly get lost in the annals of history, the Hawks getting off the canvas to produce a knockout, [Gary Lyon getting abducted by aliens](https://www.reddit.com/user/Clarkey7163/comments/1n9ul85/aliens/?share_id=OJ-QWlTOmmzto5Qk1aJmj&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1), and some great individual performances, among them Blake Hardwick keeping Toby Greene goalless.

The Giants lose an Elimination Final for the first time (They were 4-0), the Hawks kick 100+ points against GWS for the first time since 2013, they've now won 98 consecutive games scoring 100+ points, and for the second year running, they'll play a Semi Final in Adelaide.

Also, oddly enough, the Hawks haven't lost a final on a Saturday since the 2012 Grand Final.

**Fremantle vs Gold Coast**

In the Gold Coast's big finals debut against the unwashed purple masses of Fremantle in Perth, the weather and the pressure played a part early on with just a goal apiece in a tough 1st Quarter that featured several missed shots at goal (Notably King Freddie's shit dribble kick), then the game opened up in the 2nd Quarter as the teams went goal for goal, and after Murphy Reid put Freo in front, the Suns put the blowtorch on and kicked 4 goals in 10 minutes to open up a 25 point lead at half time, 7 goals to 4 in all. 

At that point it looked like classic Fremantle - Shitting the bed under the weight of expectation, but the Suns didn't put them away in the 3rd Quarter as they missed a few chances...

And with the crowd being taken out of the action, Isaiah Dudley bobbed up out of nowhere and kicked 2 quick goals to cut the lead to 15 points at the last change.

With the crowd back in full voice and Nat Fyfe off the bench, the Dockers got within 7 points, then Treacy kicked his 2nd to get them within 1 point, then Luke Jackson took an enormous mark and goaled to give the Dockers the lead with 3 minutes to play...

But the Sun wasn't setting on the Gold Coast just yet, and Mac Andrew got free and goaled to tie the scores with a minute left, setting up the chance for a rare case of extra time in a final, then the Suns won the clearance in the last minute, and in a brutal ending, Brennan Cox held on to super sub David Swallow too long, and in a fitting finish, **the first player ever drafted by the Suns kicked what appeared to be a 50-metre goal to win the game...**

Only for it to be revealed as touched on the score review, which ironically fucked Fremantle who needed to go 160 metres in 9 seconds, and it's Fremantle, so predictably it ended in heartbreak.

The Suns win their maiden final by a point, the 20th final in history to be decided by a point, the second time a WA team has lost a final at Optus by a point, Damien Hardwick has won his first Elimination Final at the fifth time of asking, and David Swallow prolonged his career, at the expense of Nat Fyfe.

**ALSO, THAT NOW MEANS.... PINEAPPLE GRAPPLE FINAL NEXT WEEKEND!**

Fancy that, we'll have had every single local derby play a final against each other **BEFORE A WESTERN DERBY FINAL.**

**LOL of the Week/119 Award**

------

The first edition of the Finals LOL, aka the 119 Award, and good to see the candidates come flying in:

The Crom for shitting the bed as minor premiers, Hawthorn damn near sealed it by blowing a 7 goal lead but fought back to win, Cam Rayner's double dive was pathetic, Stephen 'Rowie' Rowe finally gets an appearance in here for his take on the Quaynor booing, King Freddy's dribble kick that came back to haunt Freo....

**BUT THIS WEEK'S WINNER, mainly because I fucking hate the wankers for never putting my bowls wins in the Sports results, is [THE WEST AUSTRALIAN, FOR THIS FABULOUS BACKFIRE OF A BACK PAGE.](https://i.imgur.com/fidJXcc.png)**

Often players are simply commodities, worth this or that and players bite back by not honoring their contracts and requesting trades away, especially from struggling teams (not always I know).

Gold Coast have got more wrong than right over the years. Especially Eade, who played swallow in the reserves, for him only to hurt his knee. But, finally they got this right! Picking Swallow is one of the most important things they could have done. We might win tonight, however, picking Swallow is not going to be the reason we lose. Although, It might be the reason a young kid stays next time though, when they see that club actually has loyalty to its players. Picking him is so important to the culture of club long term.

Brisbane beat Geelong in their latest match before yesterday, in June. 

→ Geelong beat Brisbane last night. 

The evidence is clear. Whoever lost the most recent matchup WILL win the finals match. This is empirical. So, here's how the rest of the finals series will play out:

Fremantle beat Gold Coast in May.

→ Gold Coast will play Brisbane next week. 

And Hawthorn beat GWS in March... 

→ GWS will win and play Adelaide. 

Adelaide beat GWS in April.

→ Adelaide out in straight sets. GWS will advance to the prelim and play Geelong. 

Gold Coast won the last Q clash in July. 

→ Brisbane will face Collingwood in a GF rematch in the prelim. 

GWS beat Geelong in July.

→ Geelong GF.

Brisbane beat Collingwood in August. 

→ Collingwood GF.

And because Geelong beat Collingwood last time, my tip for 2025 premier is:

They played the Hawks in round 3 to test their premiership credentials. The Kangaroos looked dead and buried in the third but like all flag contenders, they lifted. They kicked 5 unanswered goals steamrolling the Hawks playing incredible football. They needed one straight kick for the lead, when Tom Powell received a handball from Jaiden Stephenson and steadied from 45 to put Clarkson's men in front. However he missed to the left hand side. They ended up losing that game after Hawthorn managed to stem the flow and kick late goals to the put the game out of the reach of the Kangaroos. If Powell had kicked that goal it would have generated enough momentum for the Roos to win and achieve a 3-0 record which would have give them great belief and momentum to steamroll into a finals series and potentially win an elusive flag. However his miss caused the Roos to let the win slip and they crumbled as the season progressed. Tom Powell told 7 news not that long ago that it was ""The biggest regret of his life"" Kangaroos fans wonder ""what if"" What if Powell had kicked that goal. History may  have looked very different today. "

Will keep this brief, but I think I speak for many crows fans when I say that this whole saga has genuinely ruined one of the best things in my life.

Of course the club has made egregious errors, but this post is not about that. For many of us, r/afl is an important part of our lives. For me, it has been a big help to my mental health all year to come on this sub and talk footy.

The constant stream of posts and the crude, broad brush condemnations of 'crows fans', as well as the unrelenting vitriol towards crows supporters that are likely 10 times as upset as you all are about this (every single post about our club touches on this - for us it is not a 'side discussion' like it is for others), has made this sub impossible to browse for me. This has genuinely been emotionally hard to the point where I actually cried when I opened the sub today.

My request is this: please try to be a bit kinder to us. Please don't paint us all with one brush, and please be mindful about your tone of voice and choice of words. For many of us, this is real and it is personal - more so for queer fans. Thank you to those who are doing this already."

I was at the game in the Collingwood wing. Of the Crows fans scattered in our midst a good half of them took part in the targeted booing, and the rest were happy to justify the behaviour of their fellow fans by implying that the issue was with the ‘dobber’ Quaynor. Today, the excuses being thrown around for these fans are ridiculous, and they are the *exact* same bullshit reason that people came up with back then. I was so frustrated that the only people calling them out were Pies fans, who they were never going to listen to.



*Don’t you realise fans have a right to boo?* 



*It’s ridiculous to call fans who boo homophobic, even if I don’t agree with booing!*



*Oh, we were booing everyone.*



*I’m not booing him because he stood up against homophobia, I’m booing him for being a snitch.*



*I’m not booing him for being a snitch, I’m booing him because he targeted Rankine.*



It’s so disheartening to see the same bullshit come back from people that SHOULD have known better. I’m not saying I expect Quaynor to be bullied out of the league like Goodes was, but I haven’t felt like I did at the footy last night since that infamous game in 2013. I knew it was bigoted, everyone with common sense knew it was bigoted, and yet it happened anyway, and people continue to defend it. Watching the replay today and hearing just how loud it came across on the broadcast just ignited me all over again. I had people in front of me who brought their children to the game, who even when they stopped booing every other Collingwood player continued to target Quaynor deep into the fourth quarter. 



It’s so important to let these people know that their nonsense dismissal just doesn’t cut it anymore. You can’t hide behind vague allusions towards fans rights or justify the action as anything other than over support for homophobia.



Credit to the Crows fans who have been willing to call it out, I just wish there were more of you next to me last night. The win was sweet, and the post game applause for Quaynor was sweeter, but this should have been stomped out well before any of it was necessary.

* Plays premiers from 2 years prior in a home QF and loses comprehensively  
* Goes out in straight sets to GWS in week 2

**2025**  
* Young non-Vic team rises from bottom four to top four

Could even add in the ""beating an experienced finals team in a close game at home in the second last round of the season"" (us v Geelong - the Linc McCarthy mark game, Crows v Pies) into the mix. Is history repeating? Is Flagpies 2025 on the cards?  

To make this slightly less of a shitpost, I do see a lot of that 2019 team in this Crows group. Not a lot of finals experience and probably jumped up the ladder a lot higher and earlier than was to be expected (as opposed to maybe bottom half of the eight), and so just got torn apart by a group with major big game experience and the ability to step up to that next level. Give them a bit more big game experience as a group and I can see them up and about for the foreseeable future."

Happy for any of you to reuse and send all or part of this yourselves if you feel as let down as I do about the behaviour tonight. 

""To Whom it concerns, 

I am severely disappointed in the behaviour of the Adelaide Football Club fans who spent the entire match against Collingwood booing and jeering every time Isaac Quaynor had possession of the ball. Lets be honest, we all know why they were booing him (along with members of the crowd yelling out and calling him ""GayNor) and it was disgusting, reprehensible conduct.

It must be noted, however, that this behaviour has  been allowed and all but condoned by the management and leadership of the Adelaide Football Club. In minimising the seriousness of the actions of Izak Rankine, downplaying the damage of what he did, and attempting to weasel him out of the consequences, the Adelaide Football Club have made it clear to fans and the wider football community that they believe homophobic language has a place in our game.

Furthermore, Matthew Nicks was asked twice in his post game interview to comment on the awful behaviour of the Crows fans at the ground and he refused to comment. This was an opportunity for a leader at the Adelaide Football Club to take a stand against homophobic behaviour and supprt the LGBT community but again the club failed their fans and supporters. Fans and supporters of the Adelaide Football Club who are members of the LGBT community or allies of the LGBT commmunity have been sent a strong and clear signal they are unwelcome at the crows and their safety and acceptance as supporters is not valued by the club. 

The Adelaide Football Club owes an apology to fans and supporters who did not engage in this disgusting display, an apology to the wider football community for creating the conditions for this behaviour, an apology to all LGBT people and lastly, an apology to Isaac Quaynor himself for bearing the brunt of this overt homophobia.""

As a queer person myself it's disheartening to see the fans react that way to a player who did absolutely nothing wrong. 

I understand the vitriol towards Adelaide fans but as someone who's followed this club for all my adult life it genuinely hurts to have hateful comments directed towards me and others wearing crows memorabilia based on the comments and actions of the vocal minority. To be lumped in with those wrongdoers when I myself have done nothing wrong feels hypocritical in the situation. 

I'm at a loss of what to say... I feel fucking miserable."

When I have a bit of time on my hands, I look up old scores and attendances.

Has anybody else realized that in the 90s and 00s (even counting for the years of construction at the MCG), very seldom would you see 85,000 plus crowds even for two Melbournian teams in a final ?

I feel like that changed when Geelong and Collingwood really got rolling in the late 00s, that preliminary final crowd of 98,002 in 2007 was unbelievable and something we hadn't seen in years.

Does anybody know why in the last 15 - 20 years we have now seen so many 85,000 plus crowds in the first 3 weeks of the finals?

  
What are your theories guys?"

For each game involving Adelaide or Collingwood, in the past 5 years I calculated:

1. Free Kick Differential: Team Frees − Opponent Frees
2. Tackle Differential: Team Tackles − Opponent Tackles
3. Win Margin: Team Score − Opponent Score
4. Umpire Involvement: Which umpires officiated each game
5. Bias Indicator: Whether certain umpires consistently appear in favorable or unfavorable matches

Then I aggregated these metrics across all games for each team and cross-referenced umpire appearances.

#Adelaide

|Metric|Value (Avg per Game)|
:--|:--|
|Avg. Free Kick Diff|−0.52|
|Avg. Tackle Diff|−1.74|
|Avg. Win Margin|−2.83|
|Most Frequent Umpires|Nick Foot, Leigh Haussen, Curtis Deboy, Andrew Stephens|
|Bias Indicator|Slight Negative Bias|

Observations:

* Adelaide received slightly fewer free kicks and laid fewer tackles on average.
* Their win margin is slightly negative, but that reflects performance more than umpiring.
* No umpire consistently appears in games with extreme free kick differentials favoring Adelaide.
* Andrew Stephens and **Jacob Mollison** appear in both wins and losses, with no clear pattern of favoritism.

#Collingwood

|Metric|Value (Avg per Game)|
:--|:--|
|Avg. Free Kick Diff|2.17|
|Avg. Tackle Diff|4.61|
|Avg. Win Margin|18.74|
|Most Frequent Umpires|Justin Power, Hayden Meyer, Simon Meredith , Jacob Mollison|
|Bias Indicator|Possible Favorable Bias|

Observations:

* Collingwood consistently receives more free kicks and lays more tackles.
* Their win margin is significantly positive, which may reflect team strength.
* Umpires like Hayden Meyer and Jacob Mollison appear in multiple high-margin wins with favorable free kick counts.
* Simon Meredith appears in balanced matches, not skewed toward Collingwood.

#Umpire-Specific-Patterns

|Umpire|Adelaide Bias|Collingwood Bias|
:--|:--|:--|
|Andrew Stephens|Neutral|Mild Favorable|
|Hayden Meyer|Neutral|Favorable|
|Simon Meredith|Neutral|Balanced|
|Jacob Mollison|Neutral|Favorable|

#Conclusion

* Adelaide shows no strong evidence of umpire bias. Their free kicks are slightly below average, but not dramatically so.
* Collingwood shows signs of favorable treatment in free kicks, especially in games officiated by Hayden Meyer and Jacob Mollison.
* However, this may be partially explained by other factors not contained in the data.

Interesting choice.

**The LOL of the Year.**

Let's be honest, we know who's winning it.

Besides that, other awards on offer are the Premiership Cup, the Ron Barrassi Medal, the Jock McHale Medal, the Nobel Peace Prize, the Victoria Cross, and the US Open trophy.

Also, my fun little coincidence for this week is that 2025 will mark the first season since 2003 that finals have been played in all 5 mainland states.

In both years, the Perth final featured a team in their maiden final.

Now, the flairs have been faded, the faded are culling their weak, and the bandwagons have been circled, so let's get on with it:

-------

**FIRST QUALIFYING FINAL (1st vs 4th) - Adelaide [](/adelaide2) vs Collingwood [](/collingwood2), Adelaide Oval, Thursday 7:10pm ACST**

------

Not even 3 weeks after playing each other on an epic Saturday night, the Crom and Magpies are back at it in a Qualifying Final, with this being Collingwood's first final since the 2023 Grand Final, and Adelaide's first Final since losing the 2017 Grand Final - The only players from that 2017 team likely to play on Thursday are Rory Laird and Taylor Walker in his 300th game. 

This is the fourth final between Adelaide and Collingwood (2002 Preliminary Final, 2008 Elimination Final and 2009 Semi Final), with Collingwood winning all 3 - The 2008 Elimination Final was the only one played in Adelaide.

Also, Collingwood do have 1 survivor from each of the '08 and '09 finals against the Crows - Scott Pendlebury played in the 08 final but missed 2009 due to a broken leg, while Steele Sidebottom played in the 2009 final... it was his 10th game. 

Speaking of Pendlebury, he breaks a tie with Gordon Coventry for the most Finals appearances by a Collingwood player (32), which would put him equal-4th all-time with Tom Hawkins. 

And for the Crows, a win would be their 10th consecutive win, matching the club record from Round 13 to Round 22 of 2005 when they won the minor premiership... although, they don't talk about that Qualifying Final fuck-up.

**SECOND QUALIFYING FINAL (2nd vs 3rd) - Geelong [](/geelong2) vs Brisbane Lions [](/brisbane), MCG, Friday 7:50pm AEST**

-------

The fifth final between Geelong and the Brisbane Lions (Currently 2 wins apiece), with this being the first that wasn't a Preliminary Final (2004, 2020, 2022, 2024), and the first that wasn't in an even numbered year.

If the Lions win, they'd become only the fourth team in the AFL era to defeat Geelong 3 times in a season, joining the 1991 & 1992 West Coast Eagles (Who defeated them 4 times), and 2021 Melbourne.

Also, this Finals series marks 100 years since Geelong's first VFL Premiership - Prior to 1925, the Cats had lost 7 consecutive finals between 1900 and 1924, which remains an equal league record.

And if I could remember what else I was supposed to write for this game, I would've done it, which is why I can't fucking remember it.

**FIRST ELIMINATION FINAL - GWS Giants [](/gws2) vs Hawthorn [](/hawthorn2), ENGIE Stadium, Saturday 3:15pm AEST**

------

The first final between the Giants and Hawks, and notably it's Hawthorn's first final in Sydney since 1996, when they finished 8th and played the minor premiers Sydney at the SCG.

Among other things in that game, Tony Lockett didn't play due to a groin injury, Jason Dunstall tore his ACL and ruined his pursuit of 1300 goals, and the Swans, thanks to Craig O'Brien kicking 5 goals, won a close game by 6 points to win their first final in 51 years.

It was also Hawthorn's last game before the merger vote with Melbourne 10 days later, which was ultimately voted down.

Of course, the other noteworthy stat is that the Hawks have never won at the Showground, having lost all 8 games at the ground (6 of them to the Giants, and 1 each to Collingwood and Melbourne in 2020)... it's one of only 2 grounds the Hawks have played multiple games at and never won, the other being TIO Stadium in Darwin.

Also, the current all-time head-to-head is dead even, with 8 wins and a draw apiece since 2012.

-------

**SECOND ELIMINATION FINAL - Fremantle [](/fremantle2) vs Gold Coast [](/goldcoast2) - Optus Stadium, Saturday 5:35pm AWST**

-----

The first final to feature the Gold Coast Suns, meaning all 18 clubs have played in a final since 2012, and a common theme is that both of these clubs will have played their maiden final in Perth - Freo against Essendon in 2003, and the Suns in 2025.

If David Swallow (Himself a West Australian) does play what would be his 248th game, he'll hand back the record of the most games without a final to St Kilda hero Trevor Barker (230), and he would go into 2nd place for the most games played before a final, behind Melbourne's Robbie Flower (269) and ahead of John Murphy (242).

Also joining him in the Top 10 would be Touk Miller in his 213th game (8th place), and Jarrod Witts in game 204 (equal 9th with Tom Rockliff)

In what will also be his last game in Perth, this would be Nat Fyfe's first final since the 2015 Preliminary Final (He missed both of Freo's finals in 2022), in which time he'd achieved more Brownlow Medals than finals appearances, a problem Bob Skilton can relate to.

------

**MILESTONES, WHICH AREN'T RELATED TO THE ROLLING STONES**

------

300 games for Tex Walker [](/adelaide2), 5th Adelaide player to reach 300 games after Ben Hart, Mark Ricciuto, Andrew McLeod and Tyson Edwards

200 games for Jaeger O'Meara [](/fremantle2) (44 for Gold Coast, 99 for Hawthorn, 57th for Fremantle) and Alex Neal-Bullen [](/adelaide2) (176 for Melbourne, 24 for Adelaide)

150 games for Josh Daicos [](/collingwood2)... sadly it looks like Sean Lemmens will be stuck on 149 games forever

100 games for Jai Newcombe [](/hawthorn2) and Max Holmes [](/geelong2)

Newcombe becomes the second player drafted in the mid-season draft to play 100 AFL games, after John Noble

- North Melbourne's offer to Marcus Windhager is around $3.5-4 million over 5 years. He's expected to to stay at St Kilda on a 4 year deal though, West Coast have also entered the race 
- Jamie Elliott and Brodie Mihocek both have offers on the table from Collingwood (2 and 1 year respectively), both probably have bigger offers out there from other clubs however 
- Adelaide can be ruled out of the chase for Judd McVee (MEL), a decision on McVee isn't likely until the Dees appoint their new coach 
- Calum Ah Chee is leaning towards leaving Brisbane. Adelaide are known to have strong interest
- Wade Derksen is gone from GWS, he'll likely get to Melbourne as a delisted free agent
- Essendon is preparing a mega deal to Zac Bailey (BRI) who's a free agent at the end of next year. It's around $1.3mil a year over 6 years
- Clubs involved in the Jack Silvagni chase believe he's leaning towards joining St Kilda. Their offer is around 5 years, $800-850k a year, compared to the Dogs and Pies who are around 4 x $600k. Would net Carlton an end of 1st round compensation Pick 
- Clubs will enquire about Adam Treloar, as he doesn't have a new deal on the table from the Bulldogs but wants to stay. It's the last year that Collingwood are paying him $300k 
- Brandon Starcevich's decision between staying at Brisbane or moving to West Coast is set to go down to the wire
- Sydney and Richmond are the two clubs at the front of the chase for  Malcolm Rosas Jr (GC)
- Jacob Wehr (GWS) can be locked in for a move to Port Adelaide as a free agent (previously delisted meaning no compensation for the Giants)
- Players who's season has ended but are still un-signed is typically a signal that they're looking to see what else might be out there. Jesse Motlop (CAR) and Peter Ladhams (SYD) are in this boat 
- Ned Reeves is now leaning towards extended his deal at Hawthorn beyond the end of next year
- Carlton has turned it's back-up ruck attention to Liam Reidy (FRE) and he is likely to move there
- Liam Ryan (WCE) is doing a medical at St Kilda on Wednesday (presumably meaning today), a trade still needs to happen there though
- Will Brodie (FRE) is expected to be in a Port Adelaide jumper next year, will be a very cheap and quick trade 
- Hawthorn had an 11 year offer on the table for Harley Reid (WC), at around $1.7-$1.8 mil a year
- James Worpel won't make a decision on his future until the end of Hawthorn's finals campaign, but he seems almost certain to join Geelong
- Offers for Connor Budarick (GC) could reach around 3-5 years, Brisbane are now among the clubs interested
- Max Heath (STK) is expected to join Melbourne
- St Kilda's chase of Jack Silvagni isn't likely to affect Leek Aleer's expected move to Moorabbin 
- Sam Flanders (GC) has interest from Melbourne and Carlton, in addition to St Kilda "

The aim was to look beyond disposals and see how the ball is actually used.    
I collected the below-listed metrics for five players (Daicos, Smith, Dawson, Anderson, Rowell).  

By averaging each player’s scaled metrics, I got an overall performance score.  This is the result for the 5 Browlow favourites: 

||
||
|**Rank**|**Player**|**Overall Score**|
|1|Daicos|0.583|
|2|Anderson|0.549|
|3|Rowell|0.543|
|4|Smith|0.435|
|5|Dawson|0.430|

Acknowleding that everyone values different player stats differently, the specific ones I chose show **Nick Daicos** as the deserving winner of Brownlow 2025.  I wish the outcome was more exciting but I thought it was a fun exercise and wanted to share.  

**The boring stuff:**  All non-percentage stats are calculated as average per game.  Metrics are: Tackles, Goals, Disposals, Inside 50s, Inside 50s per disposal (%), Score Assists, Score Assist per disposal (%), Contested Possessions, Effective Disposals, Effective Disposal (%), Clangers (negatively weighted), Clanger per disposal (% negatively weighted), Clearances, One Percenters.  Luckily all favourites are midfielders so the stats carried similar value.  Metrics where higher is better were scaled between 0–1 proportionally.  

1. Negative metrics (Clangers, Clangers per disposal %) were inverted, so higher values reduce the score.
2. Percent metrics (Inside 50s %, Score Assist %, Effective Disposal %) were scaled proportionally as well.
3. This gave a scaled 0–1 value for each player per metric, reflecting the actual gaps between them.

Happy to post the raw data if anyone is interested, or redo it to include different metrics if they are indicative of how the ball is used, not just getting the ball.  

Also.... at very high risk of sounding like that Levi Ashcroft article, I also chose to include Hugh McCluggage for my uni assignment, and he got an overall score of 0.604 which is cool, but as he's not really in consideration for the Brownlow, I didn't formally include him in this post. "

I was bummed to see he wasn't coaching for the Dees any more but that's footy.

What did surprise me is that every single one of the kids was in head-to-toe Collingwood gear, they were waving flags and going off, and at least one even had some kind of custom guernsey with ""Mummy"" or some such on the back.  I wouldn't have blinked an eye if it was North or Dees or even Essendon but Collingwood? 

What gives? Has lax parenting led to a divided household? Did the Browns kidnap some local waifs to add to the clan? Or is it even worse: Does Ben Brown and/or Mrs Brown actually go for Collingwood?

Someone speculated that the Browns were simply looking after the kids of some of the Collingwood AFLW players who they were no doubt friends with due to Ben's substantial relationship as a player and servant of the game.  Happily that person was immediately pegged as the conspiracy theorist they are and promptly told to 'strap on an Aussie flag and fuck back off to the March for Australia with the other cookers'. "

\*\*Unfortunately I cannot include single team rankings e.g. Draw FC at 1 etc

\*\*\*Any grouped teams e.g. Draw FC & The Bye at 19 are sorted in the order provided

**Over Performers vs Under Achievers**

The way I calculate my power rankings is each team is given a score between 1-18 dependant on a users ranking, 1 point for the team ranked 1st & 18 points for each team ranked 18th etc.

Here is the AVERAGE score of each team taken from the average score from each round:

|\#|Team|Average|Difference vs Final Ladder|

1. The rule of 10: Every decade each AFL club gets to select up to 10 (in any combination of) NGA, FS, and NA prospects, they are taken with prospect tokens. This will not make it harder to take players in the draft but will require clubs to actually think about drafting a player. For example if the GCS wanted to draft all of the players tied to their club this year but had already used 8 of these tokens they wouldn’t be allowed to draft all of these players resulting in other clubs taking whoever they want after the 2 tokens are used. This also doesn’t have the effect of giving all the smaller clubs their tied players to other clubs. In the 11th year all tokens used in the 1st year are given back to be used again. This prevents clubs from having too many players on their list tied to the system while giving clubs like the saints and north a chance to draft players they actually want creating faster rebuilds. If a club takes a player tied to one of their systems a token will automatically be used as well just to try and prevent clubs from taking their own draftees.

2. A separated draft: For players who fall under the rules of the NGA, FS, and NA system all 18 clubs will hold a draft where for the first 18 picks, they choose a player under their jurisdiction and after that any club can take a player from anyone’s system without bidding allowed resulting in the best recruits to be taken by their clubs with impediment while the others are still likely to be drafted but might not be by their clubs. This will be held in reverse ladder order like the actual draft which allows the worse clubs to pick better players while not having to trade up the draft to do so. We could even have draft trading meaning if your club didn’t have a player deemed first round worthy you could trade with another club in next years draft who also doesn’t have a player worthy to get more high level players while not diluting the current draft.

3. Little list tweak: For many years now the VFL, WAFL, and SANFL level has been plagued by sub par players and filled to the brim with hope of playing at AFL so why not let that be the case. Throughout the year if a player in your lower level representative is going bonkers you have either the ability to play them for 2 games at AFL level or if a player is injured for the rest of the year elevate them up to AFL level for the rest of the year. This keeps the competition and allows for significant growth at what feels like a dying system. I’m only saying this because some clubs who have a horror run with injuries deserve the chance to scout more players. Like WCE, CFC, EFC, and the RFC have all had in recent history.

4. Just make them pay: Literally just reverse the discount and that’s it everything could be so much easier if they would just do it. I don’t care how much we have to pay for walker just let us get him.

Anyway these were two ways the AFL could not screw over Carlton and Essendon when they are about to get potentially club changing draftees.
Also anyone can steal these ideas for their own if they want I don’t own them and never will."

Along with the absurd scores kicked by Port (had the record for 24 hours lol) and North, we had two games go down to the wire with Sydney and Melbourne prevailing over Geelong and Collingwood in the last possible minute.

Bulldogs v Hawthorn was also technically close but after watching that whole game I am pretending it didn't happen.

Ella Roberts FC also continue their winning ways under Not Ella Roberts, to defeat the non-Ella Roberts team. The scores were Ella Roberts at 3 quarter time with Ella Roberts storming home to win by Ella Roberts points.

Maybe the season stays the same length, but after everyone's played each other once, the bottom six teams get split into their own separate fixture? And the top 12 teams play off for Finals positions / rankings? The gulf between the Finals contender and the teams that are rebuilding / struggling with injuries / both is enormous, and turns a lot of late-season rounds into slop.

Rationale: even if we ignore all the AFL policy / governance snafus, the 2nd half of this season has been a grind, and almost completely meaningless. No team fell out of the Top 9 after Round 10 (middle of May). In the *whole* second half of the season, there were only four games in which a Bottom 9 team beat a Top 9 team:

Rd 13: **Port Adelaide** 9.12 (66) def **GW Sydney** 7.8 (50) -- 16 pts  
Rd 17: **Sydney** 14.10 (94) def **Fremantle** 12.11 (83) -- 11 pts  
Rd 22: **Sydney** 13.14 (92) def **Brisbane** 13.12 (90) -- 2 pts  
Rd 24: **Port Adelaide** 10.11 (71) def **Gold Coast** 9.13 (67) -- 4 pts

One of the exceptions was last season's minor premiers.

In that run home, those Bottom 9 teams got beat up a lot - terrible games for most fans.

Rd 14: W Bulldogs 20.12 (132) def St Kilda 8.12 (60)  -- **72 pts**

Add in an extra round at the start and it just drags the season out too much.

The only way it could work with Opening Round is if:
The AFL creates an extra round (24–25 games per club), but that would make the season ridiculously long.
Or they use Opening Round as a floating bye round 8 games in Opening Round, one team sits out, then another team the following week, and so on. That way the byes are spread across the season.

But honestly, the cleaner option is to scrap Opening Round once Tassie comes in. Keep it simple: each week one team has a bye, rotate it fairly, and stick to the usual season length.

On top of that, I reckon the AFL should also bring in a full league bye week mid season where every team has the week off. It would give the comp a reset, players a rest, and fans a proper breather before the run home.

What do you think keep Opening Round and try to force it, or drop it and maybe add in a full comp bye week instead?"

Umpires are now penalising holding/dropping the ball far quicker. This sends a huge warning to players that if you grab the ball then you need to get rid of it quickly. This change has instantaneously reduced stoppages and created a far faster moving,higher scoring game, which is exactly what the players, spectators and the AFL wanted. Now the AFL need to make the same change to the men’s game and we can wave goodbye to the stoppage ridden mess that we’ve had to endure over the last few decades since they introduced that stupid Prior Opportunity rule. Holding the ball is the most important rule of all and it must be strictly enforced , if it isn’t then we get 50 plus ball ups per game and no scoring and who wants to watch or play that?"

It's been a while since the EJ games, which from memory seemed fairly popular but soured a little when people found out how little actually got passed on from donations. 
I was at the game and it felt a bit flat and boring to be honest, but I watched it again on TV and the sounds and coverage absolutely made it.
I did have an issue with the old media shit canning everyone who wasn't an actual great of the game because they dont know what a podcast is. That and making the dumbest remarks about the game being planned, as if we didnt know about it. 

I liked the concept, I'd just like a little less condescending commentary, and yeah lean more into the 'influencers', that's where the next generation are, and its a fun game, so make it fun!"

It's no secret he carried Melbourne to the premiership a few years ago, and could do the same for Freo if he has a blinder finals series.

For those who have not seen this before, at this stage of the year, there are 26 possible Grand Final match-ups. I have gone through the history books to see when the last time each of them occurred. One thing to note – each year I include ~~South Melbourne’s and~~ Fitzroy's records as part of ~~Sydney’s and~~ Brisbane’s.

Not that it matters this time around, as all of the rematches occurred in the last two decades!

On to the fun stuff.

See, last year, at this stage there were ten possible rematches. In 2023, there were ten as well.

This year, that has more than halved. There is a grand total of only FOUR possible rematches on offer in four week’s time, and 22 new combos! Who’d have thought that having four teams have a total of five grand finals between them would have cut down the number… Add in that Geelong have never faced Fitzroy/Brisbane and Collingwood have never faced Hawthorn, and we get even fewer possible chances for sweet, sweet revenge on the last Saturday in September.

**To the possible re-matches:**

|Team 1|Team 2|Year|Score|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brisbane|Collingwood|2023|Coll 12.18.90 def. Bris 13.8.86|The day Collingwood were cursed to remain on 16 flags forever. Please.|
|Fremantle|Hawthorn|2013|Haw 11.11.77 def. Freo 8.14.62|Freo's first half is now the clinical definition of stage fright.|
|Geelong|Collingwood|2011|Geel 18.11.119 def. Coll 12.9.81|Tom Hawkins' hero/villain origin story.|
|Geelong|Hawthorn|2008|Haw 18.7.115 def. Geel 11.23.89|I will never be free of this torment...|

**Brand new GF match-ups:**

|Team 1|Team 2|
|:-|:-|
|Adelaide|Geelong|
|Adelaide|Brisbane|
|Adelaide|Collingwood|
|Adelaide|GWS|
|Adelaide|Fremantle|
|Adelaide|Gold Coast|
|Adelaide|Hawthorn|
|Geelong|Brisbane|
|Geelong|GWS|
|Geelong|Fremantle|
|Geelong|Gold Coast|
|Brisbane|GWS|
|Brisbane|Fremantle|
|Brisbane|Gold Coast|
|Brisbane|Hawthorn|
|Collingwood|GWS|
|Collingwood|Fremantle|
|Collingwood|Gold Coast|
|Collingwood|Hawthorn|
|GWS|Fremantle|
|GWS|Gold Coast|
|Gold Coast|Hawthorn|

**Observations:**

* There are 9 non-VIC possible GF’s, and only 3 possible VIC-only options!
* The only two match-ups that aren’t possible at this stage are the two elimination finals – GWS vs Hawthorn and Fremantle vs Gold Coast. And neither of them would have been a rematch anyway.
* Adelaide, GWS, and (obviously) Gold Coast would all be guaranteed a new match up if they make it.
* It feels really weird to write one of these without having to point out the god-awful record of Sydney and/or Collingwood in GF’s…

So let’s hear it! Which rematch would you most like to see? Which new pairing? Are we entering a period of non-VIC dominance? If so, will the AFL launch another enquiry?

Adelaide are:

\-          6/6 for Home games

\-          0/4 for Away games

Adelaide cannot beat a good opponent away from home, whilst not having dropped a game at home.

I expect Adelaide to beat Collingwood in Adelaide and then whoever they play in the prelim to make it to the Grand final before losing to a strong opponent at the MCG.

Adelaide could break this pattern but with Rankine out I see the break in pattern more likely to be a loss at home then winning away from home.

 

Why Geelong or Brisbane?

Whoever wins that qualifying final on Friday, should then win the following preliminary against most likely an ageing Collingwood outfit who after tough back-to-back games will be exhausted.

 

Reasons Geelong win the GF

\-          Lots of finals experience

\-          17 premiership players on their list (they know how to get it done)

\-          Partial home ground advantage

 

Reasons Brisbane win the GF

\-          Lots of finals experience

\-          22 premiership players on their list (Reigning Premiers)

\-          Have played well away from home this year"

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’d appreciate any advice.

I’m 22M and I’ve never been good at sports, especially ball sports. Because of that, I didn’t play much growing up, and now my hand-eye coordination feels non existent. I recently joined a social oztag team, and it’s been pretty discouraging. I fumble easy passes, freeze up when the ball comes my way, and feel like I have no control over my body. A lot of it seems to be fear and performance anxiety, which just makes it more frustrating because I don't have an accrurate gauge on where my abilities stand. 

This has always been a big insecurity of mine, and now I’m really motivated to change it. I want to get past the idea that I “just suck at sports” and start building some real confidence in my athletic ability.

My question is: what resources, drills, or approaches would you recommend for a complete beginner who wants to improve their basic athletic skills from the ground up?

Cheers"

What are power rankings you ask?  
Through your own superior wisdom, statistics or even a computer model you've created, you get to decide the best and worst teams ranked in order. Some individuals like to focus on historical team strength, for others it'll be a pure form guide, whilst some like to use it as a ladder prediction but for most it will be a combination of all, but the choice will be purely up to you!

Still, Closing Round was far more useful than Opening Round because it did give us the last result of the home & away season, which means it's time to **FADE THE FLAIRS OF THE UNWORTHY**, and after 15 seasons in the league, **the Gold Coast Suns will finally make an appearance in the AFL Finals, confirming the Western Bulldogs as being the first team in 33 years to miss the Finals with 14 wins.**

Going through the record books, that's also the longest wait for any team to make their maiden finals appearance since Hawthorn, who entered the league in 1925 and didn't play a final until 1957.

**Now, as promised on Sunday, I will be copying and pasting what I wrote in March to complete the Opening Round Post Round:**

------

In a decent opening to 2025, Hurricane Hok struck the SCG in Dean Cox’s coaching debut, as the Hawks got off to a good start and led by as much as 27 points in the 3rd Quarter, the Swans came back and got within a goal, then the rain arrived and the Swans wouldn’t score another goal, as the Hawks steadied, thanks in part to Ollie Florent pulling a Luke Ablett and gifting Hawthorn a goal, going on to win by 20 points.

-------

After an agonising 2 day wait for the next game, the Collingwood Dad’s Army didn’t bother sandbagging their houses prior to the game, and they paid the price as they were consumed by the Orange Tsunami, and combine that with poor goal kicking and you get a 52 point blowout.

The Orange Team are up and running once again.

-------

Then, after 6 months of waiting, the Suns had to win a Wednesday night special to finally make an appearance in the Finals, and despite the minor threat of the finals cock-up of the century after losing on Friday, it was apparent that several Bombers players were using the Gold Coast as a connecting flight to Europe, and in a game largely devoid of pressure, the Suns blew the Dons away with 7 goals to 1 in the opening quarter, which also enabled the entire Bulldogs list to exchange water for some form of alcohol.

And, such is Essendon's luck in 2025 that after their Mad Monday was delayed, they had several players go down injured as Matt Guelfi was subbed out with a corked calf before half time, and shortly after Todd Goldstein went down in a head clash with Xavier Duursma and didn't play in the 2nd Half, which would be a rough way to end his career after 345 games. 

With the Bombers thinking elsewhere, the Suns kicked 14 goals in the 2nd Half and ultimately romped away to win by a club record 95 points, confirming 7th spot and a date with Fremantle in Perth, Ben King matched his career best of 7 goals to confirm 2nd in the Coleman Medal, and the only Dog appearing in September is Snoop Dogg. 

-----

**LOL of the Week**

------

Funnily enough, Fox Footy were the LOL back when Opening Round first concluded thanks to their oversized score graphic that got fixed...

**AND once again, it's FOX FOOTY for attempting to use footage of Willie Rioli receiving his 2018 premiership medal in a story about his retirement....** **[the only problem was it was Liam Ryan getting his premiership medal.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1n07vo2/fox_sports_sad_bungle_showing_liam_ryan_receiving/)**

-------

**And the SMH of the Week.... it's still Bunnings for selling /u/Jawdanc a 2-year-old can of Coke.**"

Do the hawks then put all there eggs in one basket and try land Trac this trade period? Does he really want out of Melbourne as bad as last year where the massive bombshell broke. It’s going to be very interesting. I still believe Trac is a superstar of the comp but I think I would rather wait till next to they get butters who’s also 4-5 years younger than Trac too. I could see Trac more likely at a Carlton or Collingwood over Hawthorn. We all know Pies don’t have the cap space but I think Carlton could come in for him. Hawks are the likely destination if he were to move but let’s say Nathan Buckley comes in I think Oliver goes and Trac stays maybe, going to all play out on who the senior coach is? Hawks will most likely loose Worpel to the cats but we can all pray Will Day can have an injured free hit at it next season. So many big names, this trad period will one of the biggest in recent history. Charlie Curnow to Sydney is being talked about a lot in the media in the recents days, if Sydney land him they jump straight back into top 4 calculations easy next szn imo. "

As per this story the AFL hasn’t yet decided how to gain purity in the draft but clubs believe they might prevent all clubs from early 2026 FS, NGA & academy access. Blues would fiercely lobby against it given it would cost them the right to match a bid for top 3 pick Cody Walker

Most clubs with northern academies don’t have players who at this stage are top 10 contenders for the 2026 national draft. The Power have Dougie Cochrane but the AFL has to rule on him being linked to Port which it hasn’t done yet. So it’s the Blues with everything to lose"

**2 of them go out this weekend, and another one loses next week.**

Funnily enough, this was the first season in league history that all 4 teams have appeared in the same finals series.

On top of that, the 4 teams have a cumulative total of 16 years of premiership droughts, which is only second behind the 2011 Preliminary Final set, which contained the last 4 premiership clubs (West Coast 2006, Geelong 2007 & 2009, Hawthorn 2008 & Collingwood 2010).

It's also the first year since 2019 that both Preliminary Finals have been at the MCG, so expect to see crowd totals exceeding 190,000+ people over the 2 games.

-------

**2nd Preliminary Final - Geelong [](/geelong2) vs Hawthorn [](/hawthorn2) - MCG, Friday 7:40pm AEST**

------

The 11th final between Geelong and Hawthorn, with the Hawks leading 6-4, with this being the second Preliminary Final between the teams (2013), and the teams' first finals matchup since the 2016 Qualifying Final that Geelong won by 2 points as Isaac Smith missed a shot after the siren for the Hawks... he would later win a Norm Smith Medal with the Cats.

The only survivors from that 2016 QF that will play on Friday are Mark Blicavs, Patrick Dangerfield and Jack Gunston (Rhys Stanley could make it 4 survivors), while Sam Mitchell is now the coach of the Hawks, and James Sicily was a late withdrawal from the game.

The Cats become Hawthorn's second-most common finals opponent behind North Melbourne (15), breaking a tie with Carlton on 10 finals - By comparison, Hawthorn would be Geelong's fifth-most common opponent, behind Collingwood (26), Essendon (13), and Carlton & Richmond (12).

Geelong has not defeated Hawthorn in a knockout final since the 1963 Grand Final - Since then, the Hawks have won all 4 knockout finals between the teams (1989 Grand Final, 2000 Elimination Final, 2008 Grand Final and 2013 Preliminary Final.)

Hawthorn joins North Melbourne in 2015 as the only 8th-placed teams to make a Preliminary Final in league history - The Kangaroos lost that Prelim by 25 points against West Coast at Subiaco, after leading at Half Time. 

The only previous time Hawthorn have played on September 19 was the 1987 Preliminary Final against Melbourne, when the Hawks came from 22 points down at 3/4 time to win by 2 points, capped off by kicking 2 goals in the last minute of play, the last of which was [Gary Buckenara's goal after the siren.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Abvu0va_Co&pp=ygUmMTk4NyBwcmVsaW1pbmFyeSBmaW5hbCBhZnRlciB0aGUgc2lyZW4%3D)

In fact, both clubs have won a Prelim Final after the siren.

Geelong are 4-1 in Finals on September 19, winning the 2009 Prelim, 2008 Prelim, 1992 Prelim and 1953 Prelim on the day - Their only defeat being the 1981 Preliminary Final against Collingwood, a game best remembered for Garry Sidebottom missing the bus to Waverley. 

Peter Johnston took his place, despite having half a chicken, a bucket of chips and a strawberry thickshake for lunch, plus smoking half a pack of Winnie Blues.

Jeremy Cameron is currently on 85 goals for the season - If he does kick 5 goals before the end of the Cats' season, then he would be the first player to kick at least 90 goals in a season since Buddy Franklin (113) & Brendan Fevola (99) both did it in 2008. 

Finally, Chris Scott coaches his 10th Preliminary Final, breaking a tie with Kevin Sheedy and matching Mick Malthouse for the second-most Preliminary Final appearances as a coach, with Collingwood's Jock McHale holding the record with 13 (His first was in 1917, and his last was 1948.)


------

**1st Preliminary Final - Collingwood [](/collingwood2) vs Brisbane Lions [](/brisbane) - MCG, Saturday 5:15pm AEST**

------

The 5th Final between Collingwood and Brisbane, with the ledger square at 2 wins apiece - Collingwood winning the 2003 QF and 2023 GF, Brisbane winning the 2002 & 2003 GFs.

With the win last week, the Lions are now 9-3 in Finals as the defending premier (3-0 in 2002, 3-1 in 2003, 2-1 in 2004, 1-1 this year).

Chris Fagan matches Leigh Matthews (1999, 2001-04) with 5 Preliminary Finals as coach of the Lions... despite being a premiership coach for both clubs, they were the only 5 Prelims Lethal Leigh ever coached. 

This is Craig McRae's 99th game as coach of Collingwood - if the Pies do win, he'd be the first league coach to reach 2 Grand Finals in his first 100 games since John Longmire, with the 2014 Grand Final being Horse's 99th game as coach of the Swans.

Fun fact, the Magpies have more Grand Final appearances (1) than finals scoring 100+ points (0) with Fly.

While Fly has defeated the club he won 3 premierships with in a Grand Final, the last time a former player coached a Prelim Final win against their old premiership club was Chris Scott against the Lions in 2022... Damien Hardwick also did it against Port Adelaide in 2020.

The last time the Lions lost a final against a coach who wasn't a former Lions premiership player was the 2021 Semi Final against Luke Beveridge's Western Bulldogs... They are 8-3 in Finals since then, with all 3 defeats coming from Scott and McRae.

Collingwood have appeared in 6 previous finals on September 20 - The last was the 2003 Prelim against Port Adelaide (Won), plus the 1980 Prelim against Geelong (Won), the 1969 Prelim against Richmond (Lost), the miracle 1958 Grand Final against Melbourne (Won), the 1952 Prelim against Fitzroy (Won), and the 1902 Grand Final against Essendon (Won).

The Lions have only appeared in one final on September 20 - The winning 2003 Preliminary Final against the Swans.

**And finally, the Lions have won Premierships in years ending in 1, 2, 3, 4 but until this year had never won a final in a year ending in 5, while the last time Collingwood appeared in a Grand Final in a year ending in 5 was...**

**1955, when they lost to Norm Smith's Melbourne - Their only premiership win in a year ending in 5 was 1935.**

-------

**Yes, apparently there's milestones this week**

-----

Scott Pendlebury's [](/collingwood2) 33rd final moves him into outright 4th for finals played, behind Burgoyne, Tuck and Selwood.

His next game, either next week or in 6 months, would see him tie Michael Tuck in 2nd all-time on 426 games.

Patrick Dangerfield's [](/geelong2) 30th final, becoming the 8th player to play 30+ finals (7 with Adelaide, 23 with Geelong)

Billy Frampton's [](/collingwood2) 50th game for Collingwood

Teams are currently entering the trade period and draft expecting the first round of next years draft to be of lower value due to some level of top picks being delivered to tassy. If suddenly half way through next year after dragging their feet the AFL decide to delay tassy to 2030 it will be already to late for many teams, already having planned the next two years of potential trades and drafting going into this years draft. 

Will give a good example for pick two having a consequential impact on draft order, WCE select Dursma and Cooper duff tytler with pick 1 and 2. Now WC make the decision to select a long term ruck prospect this year because they know their local boy Axel Walsh likely to be a top 3 pick (honestly could easily be pick 1) next year and will be going to Tassy by default. Now dons would love a victorian ruckman like CDT so if Walsh was still on the table wce could trade down to pick up a midfielder like sharp and give essendon first swing at CDT. WCE go into next year knowing theyre targeting their local boy and likely plan the trade period with that in mind. 

Likely dozens of examples in the first round or two that change the outcome of the order with teams seeing this year as their last opportunity to pick up top talent (in a shallow draft) for the next year or two. "

1. throttling the salary cap of serial top 4/8 sides
2. limiting/eliminating access to free agents and high value players for serial top 4/8 sides.

Are these workable, fair?  Have they been discussed?

  
Edit/Response: 

 I was thinking more of tweaking salary caps rather than “smashing” clubs.  

But I am concerned about the players who are looking for the easy option to go and grab some silverware from a perennially successful club.  This effectively gives discounts to “well run” clubs.  I think making this harder is fairer.  Maybe I am delusional.

But hey, my club is doing fine as a destination club, so happy to welcome disaffected, discount, elite talent, every year forever more.

And for the tedious claims of Cats rorting the salary cap, bring some evidence or quit your pathetic whining.

Thanks all for helping me think this through.

>>“Traditional footy heartland in Victoria (245,000), South Australia (69,800) and Western Australia (88,300) continues to drive strong participation numbers across all levels of footy.”

>>“As the elite game thrives across the Sunshine State, so too does grassroots participation. Queensland leads the nation with a 13 per cent spike in participation, growing to nearly 85,000 participants.”

>>“Supported by a 10 per cent year-on-year increase in participation in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, with over 73,000 people lacing up their boots”

SA has the lowest participation of the states I have mentioned, but the issue is probably the highest proportion of the population that actually plays, leaving less room for growth than NSW/ACT and Queensland has. But footy is no longer the most played sport in SA, soccer and basketball are both ahead. There’s definitely a case for Port and the Crows to make to the AFL.

Adding to that;

SE QLD has over 3.6m people vs Adelaide’s 1.47m. Last year Brisbane grew by 73k (2.7%), Adelaide just 22k (1.5%).

The Lions and Suns are in a booming market with draft concessions, Port and the Crows are capped in a city half the size and growing half as fast.

If the AFL wants real equalisation, SA clubs deserve the same advantages handed to the northern states.

What does it look like? Imagine if Port and the Crows got Rankine, Dawson, Luko, JHF, Rozee and so on, with a 10/20% draft discount. Both teams would have better lists but still a tier or two below Brisbane and the top Victorian clubs."
1nieywu,Port Adelaide set to announce appointment of Hawthorn development coach Andy Collins (also in talks with Stuart Dew at Brisbane),eathbau,46,21,1758022569.0,2025-09-16T11:36:09+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nieywu/port_adelaide_set_to_announce_appointment_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nieywu/port_adelaide_set_to_announce_appointment_of/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"Port Adelaide will turn to a Hawthorn great and former SANFL mentor to boost its experience around first-year senior coach Josh Carr.
And Carr could also be heading towards a reunion with 2004 premiership teammate Stuart Dew.
The Advertiser understands that Port will announce the appointment of Hawthorn development boss Andy Collins in a coaching development role whenever the Hawks’ season is over.
Collins has a lengthy coaching CV that includes steering VFL clubs Williamstown (2015) and Sandringham (1997) to flags, as well as being in charge of West Adelaide for six seasons.
The triple premiership-winning Hawk led the Bloods to a SANFL grand final in 2012 and Foxtel Cup win the next season.

Collins, 60, is expected to fill a void left by Rob Mason’s departure to Tasmania Devils.
Mason worked in coach development at the Power for nine years.
Port has also been in talks with former Gold Coast Suns coach Dew about a return to Alberton to oversee the club’s midfield and a final decision from the ex-Power fan favourite is not expected until after his team, Brisbane, finishes its campaign.
Dew, who played 180 AFL games for Port from 1997-2006, was believed to have been close to rejoining the club last year, only to remain at the Lions.
The 47-year-old joined Brisbane midway through 2024 in a part-time specialist role and was part of their flag success, then took over as forwards coach after Murray Davis was appointed as Adelaide’s coaching director.

1nidttk,Will the State of Origin revival match the All Stars Game success,QuarterFooty,4,5,1758018845.0,2025-09-16T10:34:05+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nidttk/will_the_state_of_origin_revival_match_the_all/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nidttk/will_the_state_of_origin_revival_match_the_all/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"It has been a contested debate over the course of 20 years of bringing back one of the most fabled concepts in Australian Football, State of Origin. Now with the first official game in 27 years scheduled for February 14th at Optus Stadium in Perth. Old rivals Victoria & Western Australia will take the field in the revived game. 

Getting to the heart of the subject, last season the All-Stars Indigenous Game was also brought back after a 10 year absence when the All Stars took on the Fremantle Dockers at the same venue. And with its revival it was proven a success, with nearly 38,000 fans in attendance. 

Now the big question will be, will the revived State of Origin be able to match or even surpass the success of the All Stars revival, and potentially with the AFL scheduling a double header of both concepts for pre seasons to come."

1nid9il,Post-COVID AFL finals crowds vs the early to mid 2000s — has the hype exploded in the new era of footy?,legend434,12,16,1758016833.0,2025-09-16T10:00:33+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nid9il/postcovid_afl_finals_crowds_vs_the_early_to_mid/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1nid9il/postcovid_afl_finals_crowds_vs_the_early_to_mid/,AFL,False,False,False,True,"Just having a look through Wikipedia over the crowd figures for various finals played in the 2000s period (2000 - 2010 ) and some of these finals crowds look quite abysmal for finals games in Victoria. A big example of this is Victorian team vs interstate team finals. Just look through the many different crowds at the MCG in a final when a Vic team played an interstate team during 2000- 2010 period. 


Compared to those days, the crowds now in the post COVID era are absolutely massive for basically any final. You will struggle to actually get a ticket if you're playing any team bar GWS. 

Which makes me wonder whether the game has become even more of a giant in the true AFL heartland states?

 Or were people somehow poorer back then? 

Or has social media played a massive part in generating this level of hype and total sell outs in finals games?

The lowest MCG finals crowd in recent years was very near 70,000 between the giants and saints in 2023. For two small teams , that is absolutely massive when you compare to some of the early 2000s finals crowds. Like for example Pies vs Adelaide only got a tiny 62k to an MCG semi final in 2009. That would absolutely be unimaginable in this day and age. That game now days would be an easy 85k crowd if not more. In that same year the cats vs pies only got 87k to the prelim.
