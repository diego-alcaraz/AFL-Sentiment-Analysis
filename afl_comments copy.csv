I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front, I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first, he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

He doesn’t seem the most self aware player in the league. 

The fact that he will refuse to go to any team that isn’t Hawthorn means that whatever Essendon say won’t affect his value because there isn’t a bidding war.

Caro jumping to disrespectful and then refusing to back in what she was told is the issue here clearly, but its still odd. 

> But Merrett, 29, has been shattered by the claim which stems from a training session with Bombers’ AFLW head of development Ben Brown.

> The Herald Sun understands Merrett completed an extra goal kicking drill taking four shots on goal on the same side of ‘The Hangar’ indoor training building as the women’s team at Tullamarine.

> He completed the drill and then **moved on as directed in consultation with Brown** after finishing the pre-planned set amount of shots.

Like, reading between the lines, the AFLW team is training at one end of the ground, Merrett goes to kick some set shots, Brown tells him not to because they're using the area, then he decides to do it anyway, despite Brown telling him not to."

Then I think either a really good trade will get done or one won’t.  And it can really only be a win-win or back to business as usual.

Caros tone suggested she didn't think there was much to the accusation. But that the accusation was made is a story in and of itself.

I get a lot of people don't like Caro, but honestly I reckon her reporting is solid. Gets a bit sensationalist and holier than thou, but if she says something has happened, I believe that she has reason to trust her source. Sometimes the sources will be wrong, or there could be embellishment or misunderstanding. But I would strongly challenge the idea that she just makes stuff up."

That's the problem with how the shit slinging is going and making it impossible to keep him, you can't use the ""well we'll just keep him""negotiation tactic.

It'll be let him walk for whatever crumbs are offered, or deal with him in the locker room in 2026.

Had they handled it like Melbourne and Petracca where Melbourne made it clear to everyone they weren't trading him, and made it clear to him that despite him meeting with other clubs and trying to leave, they wanted him to stay. Brad Green at the BnF saying we will start 2025 with Oliver and Petracca in the centre square meant they were serious about not trading and would be over the moon to keep both players.

I suspect Essendon BnF nobody is going to speak about how much they look forward to Merrett running out for the bombers in round 1."

Got investigated by the Australian Press Council after claiming Hird was sacked, changing the article like 4 times to suggest it was coming shortly, only for Hird to remain as Essendon's coach for 10 months after the article was released.

Claimed that Hird wanted to return to Essendon, which was denied by Hird the day after, almost immediately. (this was just last year).

She said Clarkson was going to coach Essendon. He's not. He's coaching North.

Then theres the whole NWM where she double downed on her story, changed the narrative a few times, even suggested that NWM's agent has no clue whats going on.

They certainly shouldn't have allowed other players to make negative comments in the media, and shouldn't have tried to undermine him. By doing so they've both made it more difficult to keep him, and reduced his trade value because Hawthorn will see that it will be difficult for us to keep him, and they can offer less. This ""how dare you want to leave"" attitude doesn't help us at all, doesn't stop players from leaving, doesn't instil loyalty, and creates more division in the club. Why have we responded in such a way?

This makes it sound like he's unhappy playing on the wing but that's where Clarko wants him. It's a little frustrating for me also because he was a noticeably better player on the wing than in the mid. I'd like to see him there more. 


As for him being captain, supporters have made him a bit of a whipping boy partly because they don't think he's good enough on field to be captain. The fans don't choose the captain, the players do. We can't know what he's like as a leader so if they've chosen him then there's more than likely a good reason for it"

He’s actually the most annoying player. No skill but tries to kick into traffic. No strength but tries to break tackles and doo too much. Time and time again holding the ball instead of just doing what he’s good at and handballing out quickly. He’s an inside midfielder that lost his spot to 32 year old Luke Parker. 

He’s a decent player, but they made him captain and he tried to do too much and often his mistakes outweighed the good. He had some fantastic games and moments, but that’s it.

Considering we drafted heavily for young mids, he’s not going to be in our best 22 as a midfielder, possibly by next year. Even this year he played as a forward and wing when he’s neither of those things.

He needs to go to a team that can use him and doesn’t have young guys like LDU, Wardlaw, Powell and Parker who are better at that inside mid role. Or a club that has them but they’re 30. 

I could see him going to Collingwood or St Kilda and replacing someone like Jack Crisp or Jack Steele eventually. Or basically any other team that needs a hard guy to go head first into a pack and extract a ball out to somebody with vision and skill.

A late 1st rounder or a defender and a future second would do it.

AND we’d get off his contract which has 4 years left, which would be good for whoever is trading for him as they have locked him in."

WWE even used to have a mock-up wrestler for Vacant, pictured here as the reigning Intercontinental Champion. Effectively, I'm saying that Vacant has become captain of potentially three clubs this off-season:

People love a hypocrisy narrative, but for all we know, if Redman had decided to pursue a trade then he would have done it the right way by Essendon (discussing it privately with them, and accepting their decision if they said they couldn't or wouldn't get it done). The main problem with Merrett's approach is that his camp seems to have been leaking to the media to try to force Essendon's hand, putting them in a position where they ""have to"" trade him even if they can't get a fair price, because bridges have been burned and there's an implicit threat that he will be a negative presence around the club if he is forced to stay. Redman didn't do that, and there's not much reason to think that he would have."

Redman also said in that same article that; ""To be honest, whenever you go through tough periods of anything you have thoughts pop into your head about all sorts of scenarios. I certainly don't begrudge him for having those thoughts"". He's allowed to feel hurt or disappointed by the way Merrett has conducted himself, but not be angry by the concept. Not everything needs to be so black and white.

As I touched on, I don't think any Essendon fan blames Merrett for wondering if the twilight years of his career is best spent on seeing our a rebuild. They're angry by the way he has acted and gone about pursuing that. Martin and Redman words feel like they resonate with that sentiment. 

Besides, while Redman and Martin said they're a little hurt and angry by Merretts actions, most of their statements were about defending Scott from Tim Watsons assertion that the player base doesn't like him."

I think it’s arguably worse than the place I grew up in. Take Glenelg for example. Derelict, neglected and dead. I couldn’t believe how shit it was the last time I went.

As a norf man, having seen the forced exodus at our club and the fall out from that, i hope Brad Scott has a plan here cause its not looking good. They are only rumours but plenty of talk of other players like Caddy being unhappy at the club, curious if Merrett leaving would be the start of a wider exodus or if it would settle many of the problems at the club.   
  
The interview Scott did the other week was interesting, he was saying how much he uses Zach as a reference when talking about how he wants players to play and train, classic case of top student being the fav child which creates tensions.  If the rumours are true about Merrett being the star child who is really looking out for himself which has created a divide in the playing group, it will be hard to recover from for the coach and playing group if he leaves and Brad needs to find a new star child. 

Normally with a exodus narrative you are thrown out, you wander the desert before making it to the promised land.  Norf have been out wandering for a few years now and there is only now light on the horizon, I almost hope the Don's won't have to wander as long as we have but you've gotta put a few years out there guys, sorry to say."

Redman was frustrated and wanted to move and now is committed, Zach was committed and now wants out, things change. For the record as an Essendon fan I don’t care that Merrett wants to move, what makes it hurt is the conversation happened without the club getting an intention or “hey I’ve changed my mind and want success, I’m going to chat to other clubs and explore my options”.

Trac was in the same boat last year, disillusioned with his footy club.  They threw their arms around him, told him they loved him and welcomed him.  This gave them leverage at the trade table and he stayed.

I don’t condone any abuse to Merrett or his partner and anyone doing that are a disgrace to the bombers.

Trac and Merrett situations are different. Trac was known to have issues but everything happened more or less in open with the demons. Merrett a few months ago said he was committed to the journey and then later coming out wanting a trade, which want made know to the club until it came to the media saying the meeting was Sam occurred."

Roo - obviously a gun with a brownlow but I think his business sense and board contribution has also helped massively
Walker - I feel like he can be hit and miss with some other fans especially after his racism scandal, but you don't get to be the club leading goal kicker, 300 game player and AFL best captain for nothing. The way he led after Phil Walsh is his legacy imo.

The last 2 spots are very difficult. We had such a great side early 2000s. There were so many good players that had success in 97/98 that are club greats from that period, as well as those guns starting their career around this time.

My age and recency bias probably plays a big role in my decision so I would have to say Rory Sloane and maybe Eddie Betts. 
Sloane was loyal to a fault and one of the hardest and courageous players I've seen play.
Betts put bums on seats with his X Factor, something that was important for the move from Aami to Adelaide Oval.

Tricky question. I've absolutely missed some very very good players like Dangerfield."

Hodge, set the standard (full stop). An on-field coach, made sure everyone knew where to be and what to do and made everyone around him walk taller.

Mitchell, undrafted in his first year, went to Box Hill and tore the VFL apart. Worked harder and smarter than everyone else, sublime skills on both sides of his body meant he had more time in tight spaces.  

Roughead, our key forward in four flags. A good contested mark and knew how to put the ball to advantage to our crumbers in a marking contest. Covered a lot of ground, provided a chop out in the ruck and great skills by hand and foot. Everything a modern forward should be.

McLeod the literal best we've had. 

Ricciuto the best on paper and if he hadn't been so annoying since retiring then he'd be held in even higher regard. 

Walker lives and breathes the club and despite acting like a spanner, in trivial and not so trivial ways, he's been one of our greatest servants and was an absolute powerhouse of a forward.

Sloane never stopped. Through personal tragedy at home and at the club he was friendly, gave 100% every game, and is a genuine role model professionally and as a man. 

Betts gave us more joy than anyone I've seen for the club. Arguably the best at his role and would get in on that alone, the excitement he sparked in the Adelaide Oval crowd will be very hard to match by any player."

Under Malthouse, I’d have Buckley, Pendlebury and Swan as the most important were the most important,  although Didak, Maxwell, Clement, Beams, Licuria, Ball (despite only being with us a short time).

Naicos and Pendlebury are a way ahead of the best under fly, but Crisp, Cameron and Howe would have a solid shout too.

That Pendlebury and Sidebottom have played under Mick, Bucks and Fly and been really important to winning under all three eras makes them a lock.

I'd personally go something like: 
1.Gawn.

However, if you actually read the text of the Respect and Responsibility policy, you can see that the Smith incident doesn’t trigger any action. Swearing at someone doesn’t fall into any of the categories of behaviour that are identified in the policy as ‘per se’ offences. The only way the policy could have been triggered is if someone (I.e. the photographer) made a complaint. Because she didn’t, the AFL can’t trigger an investigation under the policy. Hence no sanction. 

So, although Bailey’s behaviour was bad, the league’s policies don’t give it an option to punish him ‘because he’s a bit of a wanker’. Arbitrary punishment is not a desirable outcome for anyone, and the league would find itself in all kinds of trouble if it started handing out fines or suspensions because people think a particular player is a dickhead."

At least Bailey does acknowledge what 'crosses a line'

  
From [afl.com.au](https://www.afl.com.au/news/1297033/cats-star-set-to-face-afl-sanction-for-flipping-off-fan) in April:

  
GEELONG star Bailey Smith has been fined $1000 by the AFL for his offensive gesture, as he warned rival fans ""don't talk s\*\*\* to the skipper"".

Smith starred for the Cats in their stirring comeback win over Adelaide on Thursday night, tallying a game-high 35 disposals, six clearances and one goal in an influential display.

But some of the shine was taken off the 24-year-old's performance when he was caught on video giving a double-""bird"" salute to a Crows fan as Geelong players walked down the race.

Footage of the Adelaide Oval incident quickly circulated on social media and it soon emerged Smith was reacting to taunts directed at Cats skipper Patrick Dangerfield.

The AFL fined him $1500 for making an obscene gesture and he can accept $1000 with an early plea.

""It was probably not my best moment but I was just walking off getting around the fans and then someone was just getting stuck into Danger a bit more than he should have,"" Smith told Channel Seven on Friday.

""We were in enemy territory and I kind of love that sort of stuff. I love the back and forth between the fans.

""If I had my time again I probably shouldn't have done the double-bird, but it's just all part of it and there's only so much you can cop ... but don't talk s\*\*\* to the skipper, I guess.""

Smith said he was simply flying the flag for Dangerfield, who was a predictable target for Adelaide fans all night as he kicked four goals to help sink his former team.

""He can't do it. He's got a good image to uphold, whereas I'm a bit different,"" Smith said of Dangerfield.

""I just don't like some of the stuff that was being said.

""Obviously you want to win with grace and that (gesture) wasn't anything untoward towards the Adelaide Crows in general, just the one bloke that was making a big effort to get stuck into Danger.""

Pressed for details, Smith said the supporter had been vocal about Dangerfield's time with Adelaide before getting personal in his verbal attack.

""That's where it just crosses a line,"" Smith said.

""You can judge performance as much as you like but when you start to get into deeper details it's probably a bit far."""

Making a complaint against Geelong's golden boy isn't going to win her any favours with her employer, the football club she needs to go to for work, or any friends in the greater Geelong area. It would be a terrible carrier and social move to do so.

Why is it different? Well likely because it's finals more than it's Geelong, but finals are big business in Victoria especially. The AFL are sick to death of stories not being how great the final 4 teams are but instead what a cock Smith and Scott have been to women.

To me, if the photographer accepts the apology and doesn't wish to proceed further that should suffice and be the end of it. Even if this played out in a more traditional workplace i can't imagine it being handled much more differently.

Conflict is inevitable in life, we are all adults, we deal with it and then we move on. I'm actually surprised how much people love drama and just want see others being punished."

My point is that this is not true. 

Clubs can only handle things in private when it's deemed in the public eye and eyes of relevant authorities/higher bodies that they can. 

For some reason, no one gives much of a shit that Bailey abused and swore at someone in the workplace, so by extension it has been ""handled in private"". 

There's no innate right for that to be the case."

It’s too much pressure and load for the engine of the team to be put on one guy.

You’re talking about teams that are way off. I’m not saying a midfield solves everything but HAWTHORN specifically has a problem in the midfield. Their team is much better synced overall than any of those teams you mentioned and I really think Merrett would turn them into world beaters. 

All those teams you mentioned have atrocious backlines and players that fall apart in finals, HAWTHORN doesn’t have that problem. Don’t strawman and say my argument was that only midfield matters. You can tell just by watching Hawthorn games that they become underdone by their midfield to the point where their fans will mention it every loss. EXTREMELY reminiscent of Geelong btw so I know what I’m talking about. Collingwood if you added an elite midfielder would also exponentially get better, these teams that are solid everywhere outside of midfield get exponentially better."

Trading any one of those young players doesn’t ruin structure to the degree of potential midfield improvement. Hawthorn are clearly a more structured team than any of those elite midfield teams, so in this case yes a midfield upgrade would exponentially improve them. Yes obviously fans would be mad because we all overrate our own players, but they would settle down when Hawthorn win even more and Zach is leading the Brownlow.

Bailey literally just jumped into an already great team and acted as the fuel to the system. That alone made him BoG for most games. Zach would do this to Hawthorn but even better. A great team already without a great midfield becomes one of the best teams with a midfield upgrade. A mediocre team with a great midfield become flat track bullies."

If Essendon think that Merrett can even have half of the success that Mitchell had between the age of 30 and 34, then he's worth more to us than that. Hawks were the ones that asked Mitchell to move, and he was open to it. Completely different scenario.

Hawthorn were also happy to trade Jordan Lewis as it freed up salary space. He also only had 1 year on his contract.

Tom Mitchell was pushed out of Hawks, he admits it in multiple interviews.

Sure, but in the same regard, he's also worth more to Essendon than what other clubs are willing to give up. Essendon values him highly. I don't think it'll be hard for him to go back at all.

For the record, I don’t want Merrett, I think it’s really poor form to leave the club as a captain, on top of just signing an extension so recently. If he was unhappy, he shouldn’t have resigned. But I don’t understand how it’s Hawthorn’s fault for meeting with him - he’s a good player, his management are leaking these stories so he clearly wants out

I also just don’t get why this sub hates Hawks fans so much. I don’t feel like I see us being entitled or obnoxious. I openly wished success on people for years following our success under Clarkson. Meanwhile Geelong are always at the top and manage to get an unbelievable player for $200k every year and a job at Cotton On and every here just goes “that’s Geelong for ya!

As a Blues supporter I've considered this exact situation a few times. If Cripps asked for a trade for success I'd be devastated but honestly, the bloke has busted his arse off for Carlton. As long as a reasonable trade can be done, let him go for a crack at a premiership. But the devaluation has to stop.

Word is he lobbied hard for the captaincy, he's only halfway through a four year deal, he asked the club for more money midway through a deal and was granted it, and he's consistently talked publicly about his commitment to the club. 

Also, there have long been rumours about him being a pretty divisive leader and putting people off side, being selfish, and now work of him being disrespectful of the AFLW team. Those aren't the actions of someone who has in fact given their all to the club, they're of someone whose effort is conditional on whether or not they're getting something out of it for themselves. 

I can't imagine Cripps ever behaving this way. I have no doubt he'd go to Carlton first, express his desire to move (likely home to WA), and let them sort it out behind closed doors with his management, so Carlton can control the messaging to their supporters and not look like a rabble.

Merrett has had 1 meeting that got leaked and nothing else has been said other than his manager explaining why he had that meeting. 

If all the Essendon public statements didn't happen or they simply said, we don't want him to leave we love him like Melbourne did last season Essendon could walk into trade week maintaining that they are keeping him and watch the offers from Hawthorn increase as the deadline comes. 

Now Hawthorn will start with pick 8 but come say 3 of trade week watch them trade that to someone else like they did with pick 14 last year when west coast was knocking back a deal. 

It'll get to the last minute and Essendon will need to take whatever crumbs are left because Hawthorn know Essendon can't leave that room with Merrett still an Essendon player while Hawthorn would be comfortable that they made a fair offer that was knocked back."

Let me throw in the info about how 4 clubs have been dominating the last 20 years that we're seeing. The AFL might move to fix that, who really knows. If they don't, then the Dons rolling over on this might be a sign that players can act like Merrett and chase victory over loyalty, which seems contrary to established fan culture, at least.

He had won 3 straight bnfs at brisbane whereas merrett is about to win his 6th crichton so they're not dissimilar in some ways.

The Beams deal was also a little weird - Brisbane wanted top dollar and were 100% prepared to refuse any trade, and Collingwood were also in need of draft points without any real care about actual draft position, which is why the deal finished up with an odd pick shuffle and the Lions manufacturing the 2nd late first round pick in the trade.

The ballot process is pretty simple, “buy” your ticket request through the ticketek webpage when it becomes available, and then wait to see if you in the lucky portion of members to get chosen.

If no luck, then you wait for tickets to be returned on grand final week and have another crack at accessing those tickets (there’s always some).

If no luck there, line up on the morning of to get the GA seats.

Don’t want to get up early? Go later in the morning/day of and go for standing room.

From a strategic standpoint, less seats in a bunch the better I’d imagine, and keep it to “even blocks”. Singles would be a better chance than triples, but I assume they keep doubles and quads as standard “blocks” for the ballots.

Dining ballot is same as always. Put your name in, sometimes you get it, sometimes not. I reckon GF is marginally easier to get dining vs other finals games, as no guests are at GF day, this less demand for a restaurant table. 

Re dining, we’ve had reasonable luck as a group of three, likely because it’s better than a pair, but takes up the same amount of space I imagine.

Didnt get a seat in the ballot? Jim Stynes dining room is a good plan B RE dining too. No seats are given to dining reservations for GF day like they do for other games, but Jim Stynes grill has seats in the restaurant area. Yes, you’re behind glass, but still…better than nothing."

If Merrett was a prick, that means club walked past his behaviour, that means the club then appointed him captain, and that means the club further rewarded his behaviour with a contract extension.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front, I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first, he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

The Blues [accepted the resignation of their former general manager of consumer business, Daniel Giese](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/news/carlton-senior-staffer-resigns-after-investigation-for-management-matter/news-story/2b2cc55cba652af048ace1d6ae038b1b), in April following complaints about a “management matter”.

The club at the time stressed the issue did not relate to gender-based misconduct.

The Herald Sun has confirmed three women who stepped forward as part of a whistleblower service have been let go.

The women were asked to come forward to provide information about any inappropriate behaviour and, in particular, the alleged misuse of club funds following a separate complaint to the club in March.

The concerns related to the alleged misuse of cash raised through club raffles at staff events and gatherings in 2023.

Victoria Police and the AFL integrity department were also made aware.

The women detailed grievances during the club investigation which led to key meetings with senior members of Carlton’s human resource department.

Some of the meetings – where the women were asked to detail their experiences – were held at an off-site cafe between April 1 and 14.

A submission was lodged to the AFL whistle blower portal in April about the matters.

While the women involved were assured their jobs were safe as part of the investigation, their time at Carlton has officially ceased after the trio were made redundant.

They held various roles in the club’s off-field staff but Carlton has since undergone a restructure, changing multiple positions in the consumer department.

The club told the women their redundancies were unrelated to the investigation about the senior staff member in April.

Carlton confirmed in April it had taken seriously concerns about a leadership and management matter after interviewing 10 people.

The club said in a statement to the Herald Sun on Monday it completed a club-wide restructure to enhance its on and off-field operations.

“The Carlton Football Club has recently announced changes to its workforce structure following a finalised handover of the club CEO,” the statement said.

“These structural changes are part of the club’s reset in preparation for 2026 and driven solely by the need to improve performance in key areas of the club to better meet the needs of its stakeholders.

“The club is aware of speculation that these changes were made for other reasons. This is incorrect.

“The decision to restructure, which includes four changes to the club’s executive team and their respective departments, was made following a thorough review and is designed to enhance club operations in football performance and areas that better service members and strengthen their connection with the club.”"

We all do it.  Hell, I do it all the time.

It takes a conscious effort to overcome these biases.  Many people don't bother switching their brains on most of the time.

In this case, the headline is designed to make Carlton look like they've done the bad thing.  If someone with a hate boner for the club, say a Freo, Pies or even seemingly many Blues supporter, then they will take this as further evidence as to why we suck.  

If they read the article at all, they'll conclude that 4 people were let go and 3 were the whistleblowers.  When, in fact, the article says 4 executives along with many in their teams were let go. Which is likely a much higher number.

Because they've already made up their minds, the contrary statement causes cognitive dissonance and is therefore ignored or misremembered.

*Their own data shows that people who live near Hobart don't like the stadium, and it polls 44-42 with families, the club's key demographic*

I know the business case for the stadium was based on cooked data (Taylor Swift tours, lol), but this is a whole new level. This does not feel like the actions of a confident organization, it feels like a bunch of headless chickens scrambling for something to get them through the next month. 337 is fucking *ludicrous.*

This is going into the weeds, but I don't see how this current incarnation of the Tasmanian parliament is going to be able to pass a budget, let alone fund the stadium. The progressive crossbenchers might agree to a version of the budget that doesn't include the stadium, but the Liberal Party won't try to pass a budget without the stadium. Labor would support the Liberal Party in funding the stadium, but there's no way they could agree on an actual budget.

But that isn't sustainable long-term. This was the case for a tonne of inaugural Suns members, but they didn't renew for the 2012 season and went back to primarily supporting their original team. (Citation: this was a pretty constant throughline in Matthew Webber's *The House Of The Rising Suns*) You can't build a fanbase off ""second-team"" members. The problem with Tasmania is that it's a captured market, everyone already had a first team. At least with Gold Coast their were a tonne of people that had never watched AFL before, went to a game out of curiousity, and became lifelong fans."

Cerra, for pick 6 and future third (47). Equiv pick 6

Jeremy Cameron, future second (30), future second (32), for pick 13, 15, 20, future fourth (69). Equiv pick 5.

  
Lachie Neale, pick 30, for pick 6, 19, and 55. Equiv pick 4. I want to note for this one that Neale was coming off a BnF and was 25 years of age.

  
As you can see from above. The asking price of pick 8 and a future first is probably overs. That is the is equivalent of pick 3. Merrett is 30, all of the above trades are for free or pre-agents. I just don't see Hawthorn giving up more than pick 8 and Carlton's second rounder (26).

Getting similar vibes to Barrass last year. All the media were saying has to be two first round picks, but it ended up being Barrass and a fourth rounder for what is looking like at least pick 15, pick 33, and pick 51. If Merrett really does make the situation untenable, which it is looking likely, then it is looking like Essendon will have to just accept what they can get."

The question is what does Essendon do with all those picks

They currently have 4,5,22,25.  Draper leaving via free agency might trigger band 1 which would give them pick 6 as well.  Will Ridley pursue a trade to the Lions?  If so one would think they will get at least pick 16 for him. Merrett and Ridley leaving would leave a huge hole in cap space.

Bombers should be trying to throw the kitchen sink at Petracca.  A bit like Merrett he won't be about for your next flag tilt but geez you could use that quality of midfielder to rebuild with, plus you would have the sort of draft hand to satisfy the Dees."

Problem with any pick swap deal is we already have 3 picks in the top 20 this year, likely 4 when the Draper combo comes through. We really don’t need more draft picks, we need quality experienced players to stop the kids we drafted the last 2 years from getting smashed. So unless hawks are willing to pay overs, there’s really no point in a trade for us. 

I would rather the club play hardball and make him stay if a deal can’t be reached. Merretts a relentless competitor, no way he cracks the sads and doesn’t try his hardest next year regardless of what club he’s at. 

Also the fact he’s 30 as not as big a problem as you’d think. He’s got a fantastic injury record and is meticulous with training and preparation, all the indications he’s got plenty of years left. Plus his game style won’t be negatively impacted as much by age and slowing down."

Bolton was 4 years younger with a longer contract.  He went for 10 and 11 and downgraded a pick.

Luke Jackson was 8 year younger and went for 13, F1 and F2.

Shit, port spent 2 firsts, a 2nd and junk for JHF and Rioli!!!

You dont get to just demand more because of emotion lol.  

It will be a first, a 2nd and a fringe player.  Essendon's players have contradicted their board and lkilled their leverage.  They need Zac more than we do.

I dont remember Richmond fans behaving like babies when Bolton and Rioli left for success, or Port fans when Houston asked to leave.  All of which were under contract.

It's weird that a lot of people think Merrett is going to suddenly drop off. His best footy doesn't come from anything that is affected by age. He's a bloke that has shown that even if he does begin to slow down in midfield, you can move him to half forward or half back and he'll still do good. He's one of the best mids in the comp and a very decent player to utilize around the field.

People underestimate how consistently healthy Merrett is. He's played 251 games out of a possible 265. There is only one other player from his draft class that debuted in 2014 that has played more games than him, and that's Bont, who has played 3 more games than Merrett.

At 30 years old Mitchell won the brownlow (although only after Watson handed it back in). At 33, he almost won the brownlow for a 2nd time in his career. At 34 he was still Hawthorns highest voted player for the Brownlow.

He won't be captain next year. He's not the type of bloke to sit on the sidelines intentionally though. He's also selfish enough to know that next year's performance will be a big indicator of how much he'll get paid at the Hawks. Also, frankly it sounds like he's not really an inspirer of morale anyway. You would hope that if he is with us, he does the bare minimum of facilitating a handover rather than leaving us entire listless. 

> Unfortunately I think either way Essendon are going to get screwed over in this deal.

Yes, he has completely and utterly fucked us over the barrel. He was part of the group who led the coup on Rutten, which lead into us getting Scott. Our current list and rebuild strategy was his and Brad's (with the notable exception of cutting his mates in Hind, Stringer, Laverde etc.) He renegotiated to get higher pay which we agreed to (and we didn't need to do). Then we have a horrific run of injuries this year, he still backs us in 7 weeks ago and then out of the blue he meets with another club without telling the coach (when you were at his house 24 hours prior). There were so many better and simple ways for this to be handled."

He's not an injury prone player, never has been. His performances aren't going to dramatically drop the older he gets because he doesn't rely on anything physical to be the player he is. Merrett is always looking at ways to adapt himself and his body as well, hes said as much in interviews. 

Unless he has a horror injury which could happen to literally any player any day, I don't think he's going to just suddenly drop off. Dude loves the sport more than anything, he'll want to keep playing for as long as he can.

> Chris Scott’s aggressive outburst towards a female AFL staff member was triggered by the presence of visually impaired reporter Matt “Spider” Lee at his post-match MCG press conference.
> 
> Lee, a former SEN producer who hosts a weekly program for Vision Australia radio, was the accredited media figure at the centre of Scott’s blow up after Geelong’s big qualifying final win over Brisbane on September 5.
> 
> Geelong has declined to explain why Scott was upset about Lee’s presence or detail what was said between Scott and the junior AFL staffer.
> 
> Lee said he was “shocked” and saddened to discover that his attendance at the conference had sparked Scott’s exchange with the female media official, which prompted her to later break down in tears.

> The dual premiership coach apologised to the woman five days later following discussions between league officials and Cats CEO Steve Hocking.
> 
> Lee, 45, is legally blind and suffers from an hereditary eye condition that makes his vision gradually deteriorate.
> 
> He is well known within football circles and regularly attends post-game press conferences with a support worker.
> 
> “I was a little bit shocked – and sad – to hear about it to be honest,” Lee said of his link to the incident.
> 
> “I must admit, I am a bit rattled by it.
> 
> “It’s just really disappointing that someone would say something like that behind my back.”
> 
> But the club made contact with Lee on Monday morning to reassure him that he was “welcome” at all future Cats press conferences.

> “Matt is welcome at any Geelong media opportunity and there is no concern with his attendance at Chris Scott’s post-game press conferences,” a club spokesperson said.

> He said she had been “incredibly supportive” of his role in covering footy, despite his disability.

> “She has always helped me because what happens with me and my support worker is we have always communicated with the media managers just to let people know that I do have low vision and it’s important that the coaches know that if I don’t see a cue or a gesture, I’m not interrupting,” Lee said.
> 
> Lee said he had been largely embraced by media colleagues and other coaches.
> 
> He asked Scott two questions during last week’s media conference.

> “I suppose it’s just about having an understanding and an awareness of people with a disability – just to have the respect to know that everyone is entitled to have a go at the industry.

> Scott was not sanctioned for his outburst and the AFL staffer has accepted his apology.

And for the Geelong supporters and others who are asking why the junior staffer’s gender has anything to do with it need to use some common sense. If you can’t see an issue with a man in a position of power screaming at a young woman who is just doing her job in a male dominated industry then I don’t know what to tell you.

It provides zero record of the conversation had, only very many statements that Matt Lee was disappointed and wanted to feel welcome etc. We have no idea what Chris Said to upset him, we have no idea why this other journalist involved herself, only that the female journalist was friendly with Matt Lee. I'm a cats fan so I am trying to read this unbiasedly but with such limited information what are we even doing here? 

My best guess based on the very limited amount of info given is that Matt Lee was offended by Chris Scott's blunt style of dealing with journalists, Matt took offence, and this young journalist came to Matt's defence. Chris took issue with the younger journalist defending the senior journalist (who happened to be blind) and chewed her out for it.

Also, he said he had a ""run in"" with Brad scott as well, but only stated Brad scott asked him ""was that a question or a statement"", how is this a run in? Coaches and celebrities alike ask this question all the time. There is either a lot more to the story but doesn't want to get Brad in trouble or his bar for conflict is extremely low by most peoples standards. 

The problem is that the media continues to speculate when the AFL and individuals involved have put the issue to rest. There is not enough information for anyone to come to a well informed opinion. Especially not to imply what this article is saying ""oh yeh bruh Chris hates blind people probs"" lmao"

“Last year there was an issue with Brad as well. He said to me, ‘Is that a question or a statement’ at one of the games – and that did rattle me, but I don’t think he had an actual understanding of what my disability is.”

I’d like some more context on this. On the surface it seems like very little to rattle someone but there must be more to this story. Did Brad say that in response to a question about the game or the disability?"

In terms of the reporter, it is mentioned that due to his disability, he can interrupt people or miss social cues. He is specifically quoted as saying that the AFL media team alert coaches as to his needs/requirements which is fair enough. He says that other senior coaches including McRae and Mitchell know who he is.

The article fails to mention whether a) Chris Scott has ever encountered this reporter before or b) whether he had received the briefing about the reporter's needs.

Without detail, it is entirely possible that somebody failed to brief Scott, he got frustrated at somebody interrupting and got angry at a staffer later despite the issue being around somebody else failing to do their job properly."

In terms of the reporter, it is mentioned that due to his disability, he can interrupt people or miss social cues. He is specifically quoted as saying that the AFL media team alert coaches as to his needs/requirements which is fair enough. He says that other senior coaches including McRae and Mitchell know who he is.

The article fails to mention whether a) Chris Scott has ever encountered this reporter before or b) whether he had received the briefing about the reporter's needs.

Without detail, it is entirely possible that somebody failed to brief Scott, he got frustrated at somebody interrupting and got angry at a staffer later despite the issue being around somebody else failing to do their job properly.

I'll be happy to eat my words if it turns out this didn't happen, but the lack of detail and leading reporting is poor even by Herald Sun standards."

Maybe he didn't think it warranted mentioning as he'd been in the situation before, maybe she was trying to set up a protocol for interacting with him that Scott didn't think was necessary. Who knows?

As a member of the club, the fact that we don't know is very, very frustrating. Having details drip fed out without any explanation from the club is shitty for supporters, and I think only has a negative influence on the way the club and its people are perceived. I get that we're not entitled to know every little thing that goes on, but this is clearly going to get attention regardless of what the club says or doesn't say. Put the club/player/coach's version of events out, apologise and own up to any mistakes made, show that you understand and that you won't do it again. That much the supporters do deserve.

I defended him in the sense that people made pretty harsh judgements about him without any word from him or the club about why he was shitty with the photographer, which may be relevant, maybe not. I'd like to make that judgement for myself though, as my morals and ethics are more important to me than footy.

So on one hand the clubs want the ability to move on from contracts they sign, but can't understand when players want to do the same?

Signing a contract is a commitment, in good faith, that you will be paid for your services, and your club is doing everything they can to achieve success. If the club deviates from the vision they sold you when signing the contract, why is it out of order for the player to want to move away from that contract?

Let's not also forget that clubs have the ability to delist players while still under contract, and have done so in the past.

nealpfk,t3_1nhcfml,t3_1nhcfml,1nhcfml,BusinessPooh,2,1757910805.0,2025-09-15T04:33:25+00:00,"The advent of free agency has helped football’s stars get richer than their wildest dreams but as a player movement mechanism it has been an unmitigated disaster.  

Jordan Ridley, Charlie Curnow and Zach Merrett are attempting to escape their clubs but are instead trapped in long-term deals that have made them wealthy but desperately unhappy.  

The idea of free agency was worthy when introduced at the end of 2012 to give players unprecedented flexibility to move clubs — for success, money or a return to their home state.  

The execution of it has been a dog’s breakfast. 

Consider its legacy and the unintended consequences it has forced upon the AFL and its clubs.  

It has led to ridiculously long deals like Aaron Naughton’s eight-year extension forced upon clubs because of impending free agency that we might as well call the pre-agency tariff.  

The desperate club fears that their best players might hit free agency unsigned has given stars the ultimate leverage as pre-agents seven seasons into their careers.  

It has required clubs to match those insane deals fully aware they are dangerously exposed to a player’s career-ending concussion that the AFL will not allow them to exempt from their salary caps.  

It has seen clubs like West Coast forced into unenviable decisions to gently nudge their co-captain Oscar Allen out of the door for the free agency compensation bonanza that awaits.  

It has allowed delisted players to find their club of choice much more easily.  

But ask clubs like North Melbourne chasing delisted free agent Tyson Stengle in late 2021 what they think of it as a competitive balance measure given he joined powerhouse Geelong and won a premiership as a 2022 All-Australian.  

In the past 10 years of free agency the Roos have secured just Aidan Corr as a genuine free agent (as well as delisted free agents Toby Pink, Hugh Greenwood, Josh Walker and Alex Morgan) while this year alone premiers Brisbane will pick up Allen and Sam Draper.  

Geelong secured Stengle, Luke Dahlhaus, Patrick Dangerfield and Jeremy Cameron (although eventually forced into trades for the latter pair) and a veteran called Isaac Smith who took home the Norm Smith Medal.  

Its inflationary effect has allowed players like Jack Silvagni (with one top 10 best and fairest finish in his career) and Essendon’s Draper (who doesn’t have a top 12 b-and-f finish) to accept deals of over $4m this season.  

And it has led to the kind of six-year deals Charlie Curnow signed to give away his free agency rights, seeking security over any form of flexibility in the back-end of his career.  

Carlton will desperately attempt to hold Curnow to his deal (unless they get a better trade offer) arguing that he chose to sign that deal and can accept its long-term consequences.  

In Curnow’s defence it would have been negligent for him and his management not to sign a long-term deal given the concerns over his knee.  

But he is properly stuck — unless Gold Coast decides centre half forward Ethan Read getting badly beaten in successive finals is the trigger for them to fall in love with Curnow.  

The problem for Essendon stars Ridley and Merrett is that free agency gave both of them an incentive to sign away any flexibility even if they had concerns about their futures at the Hangar.  

Merrett might have jumped ship back in 2021 but instead Essendon’s only final berth in the past six years coincided with his season of free agency.  

By a fluke of timing he falsely thought Essendon might have a bright future.  

After some equivocation he re-signed with Essendon in June that year months ahead of that finals berth and given rival free agency offers he locked himself in for six years.  

Not a two-year deal to unrestricted free agency (and total control of his destiny) but a whopper with the lot through to 2027.  

He re-signed in June 2021, Essendon then squeaked into finals with an 11-11 win-loss record and was bashed up by the Dogs in another elimination finals demolition (49 points).  

The club hasn’t played finals since.  

Ironically, the Dons trumpeted his signing on their website as “Merrett a Bomber for Life”.  

Remarkably, Ridley has actually signed three contract extensions since October 2020.  

In 2020 after a Crichton Medal victory the key defender signed a four-year deal to free agency in 2024.  

Then only a year later in September 2021 he extended his deal by two seasons to 2026 after another bumper season.  

Then in February 2024 he signed on for a further three seasons to 2029, saying he was “proud to have the opportunity to play for such a great club for such a long time”.  

So Ridley willingly signed away his restricted free agency rights, then signed away his unrestricted free agency rights, but now wants out because Essendon is ordinary.  

He is right — they are ordinary."

I understand that players can agitate away in the hopes of the club letting them leave, but that is how all contracts work.

Both Merrett and Ridley would make the case that there is no prospect of success in the near future at Essendon.  

They might say they have been sold a pup.  

Essendon went all in recruiting Jake Stringer, Dylan Shiel and Devon Smith then rebuilt again, then went all in with Ben McKay, Todd Goldstein and Jade Gresham and is now rebuilding again.  

All of that is true, but at some stage clubs who have given everything to their players might just decide that they have to suck it up.  

Hawthorn has so many attractive players and quality draft picks that there is a world in which the Dons extract a first-choice ruckman in Ned Reeves, a top-10 pick this year and a first or second-rounder next year from the Hawks.  

But there is also a scenario where Essendon decides that Zach Merrett is stripped of the captaincy next year and effectively plays as a football consultant.  

Christian Petracca’s situation was just as dire this time last year at Melbourne as he desperately tried every trick in the book to get out.  

And yet last week he finished second in the Melbourne best-and-fairest, joking that he had bounced back this year because he was paid to do it.  

He quickly backed over that remark by stating footy was also his passion, but if Essendon did hold the line Merrett would find a way to contribute next year under new captain Andrew McGrath.  

Then Essendon could trade him in a much better draft or both parties could fall back in love if the Dons are much-improved.  

Petracca found himself in exactly the same scenario as Curnow, signing his six-year extension to 2029 in mid-2021 when was footy’s most dynamic mid-forward.  

The following year his premiership accomplice in Clayton Oliver followed the same pre-agency playbook, with Oliver signing a seven-year deal to 2030.  

Now the Demons are due a combined $3m to those two players in coming years — plus $1.4m a year to Kysaiah Pickett.  

It looks like a misfire.  

But Melbourne’s only other choice was to let those contracts drift to free agency and either let players walk for a single late first-rounder or pay even more to secure them.  

Free agency forces clubs to make binding decisions on the form of players 6-8 years into the future, aware the only other alternative is to lose them to rivals who will pay them.  

Players deserve every dollar they can get because they put on the show and their careers can be over at any minute.  

But these past free seasons have also been full of prosperity.  

Players will enjoy a 37 per cent pay rise from 2023-2027 that far exceeds the meagre pay rises — if any — across the community.  

They are shielded by policies like the Illicit drugs code which protects their identities if they transgress where many in the community might lose their jobs in similar circumstances.  

They sign vast long-term deals that do not require them to pay back money if they underperform.  

Essendon has twice increased Merrett’s deal but it has no capacity to dock the pay of anyone else on the Dons list for their below-par performances.  

But for all those vast privileges the flip side is that clubs can hold them to those deals.  

It is ridiculously early in the trade process to suggest that is the only outcome for Essendon with Merrett and Ridley and Carlton with Curnow.  

But both of their coaches know that if players are guaranteed their contracts they can be sacked at a moment’s notice.  

It would take only an ounce more bad luck for an Essendon team without Merrett, Ridley, Draper and ACL victim Nic Martin to finish bottom four again and heap untold pressure on Brad Scott.  

Michael Voss will be unlikely to survive another year without finals.  

So while player power has given the current-day stars so many advantages the only negative — signing your life away to your current club — has come back to bite this trio of potential escapees on the butt."

I’ve said it before but it only works in the NRL because after decades and decades of buildup (and sporting culture/media warfare between the two states) the players *care* about it and give it 110% effort; it’s played with grand final intensity and there’s often more feeling in origin games than the grand final itself.

There’s none of that here, it’ll be a bit of a fun distraction preseason game but ultimately nobody will care and none of the players will try because the risk of injury is too great. And often I see people in response to that saying “well you have to start somewhere, maybe it will get to the same level as the NRL Origin in 10 years time”. 

It just won’t. There’s too much money involved in sport these days compared to 30-40 years ago. Imagine if Bont or Daicos does an ACL and is out for the entire season? The risk is too high."

Crows seem like the most obvious fit for him they need another top line midfielder he would get full time midfield time at the crows.

Gold Coast could be a good landing spot for him if he’s willing to move up there. Petracca, Rowell and Anderson would be solid."

By that definition every country has freedom of speech since even North Korea can’t literally stop its citizens from making banned speech. You prohibit the freedoms by imposing consequences.

The implied “freedom” is freedom from persecution from the government (as in e.g. the first amendment in the US). 

Australia doesn’t have an absolutist view on freedom of speech and that’s a good thing. We should just say “we don’t consider hate speech free speech” not whatever this weird redefining of terms is."

AFL Origin to Return in 2026 
 
The AFL is pleased to confirm the return of ‘AFL Origin’. 
There will be no love lost on Valentines Day as Western Australia host Victoria on Saturday February 14 at Optus Stadium. 

The state-based rivalry returns at the elite level for the first time in more than 25 years, having last been played in 1999 when Victoria played South Australia at the MCG. 

The very first State of Origin match was played in Perth in 1977 and the last time Western Australia lined up against Victoria was in 1992 when the Big V were victorious, defeating the visitors by 67 points, 23.19 to 13.12. 

In 2026, AFL Origin will be delivered with the support of the Western Australia government and showcase the best of the state for fans from all over the country. 

AFL CEO Andrew Dillon said he was thrilled to welcome back one of the great football traditions.  

“State football is one of the great traditions of our game, with fans and players alike calling for its return for some time and we are thrilled to see it back,” said Mr Dillon. 

“Origin inspires passion, State pride and draws upon years old rivalries that are central to the history of our game and our very greatest players. 

“I would like to thank Premier Roger Cook and the WA Government for their support in delivering this exciting event for our code.  

“It will be a special moment to see a Big V and a Sandgroper jumper back on the field before we start our 2026 Toyota AFL Premiership Season.” 

Comments attributed to Premier Roger Cook:
 
“For the first time this century, Western Australian footy fans will be able to watch our State’s best players don the black swan and take on the Victorians.
 
“Bringing to Perth a rivalry which started in the 1900s and which was defined in the legendary matches of the 1980s is a proud achievement for my government.
 
“We know Western Australians love their footy and will fill Optus Stadium to see this blockbuster match, as will many interstate tourists.”
 
Comments attributed to Sport and Recreation Minister Rita Saffioti:
 
“This is a fantastic opportunity to see some of Western Australia’s best talent on display at Optus Stadium and I know many West Australians will enjoy watching WA players at their best.
 
“I enjoyed watching State of Origin in the 80s and 90s and I want a new generation to love the game like I did.
 
“Events like this will draw huge crowds from all over the state and country and help boost our economy while also inspiring the next generation of athletes.
 
“This match will also provide a boost to our local communities with money being funded back into grassroots football so our government can continue to ensure we have the best facilities and infrastructure for everyone to access.”
 
Comments attributed to Tourism Minister Reece Whitby:
 
“Perth is making history by securing the return of AFL Origin, which hasn’t taken place in Australia since 1999.
 
“The Cook Government is committed to our economic diversification strategy - we’re incredibly proud to secure such an exclusive match and we’re confident it will have a positive impact on the State, drawing thousands of fans from across Australia boosting our tourism and hospitality businesses, and injecting millions of dollars in visitor spend into our State’s economy.
 
“Hosting an iconic match like this also boosts WA’s reputation as a world-class host of sporting events, putting the State in a position to attract bigger and better events every year, and giving visitors a time-specific reason to visit the State and extend their stay.
 
“Origin footy has a long and storied history, so to all the Victorians, and footy fans across the country, I urge you to travel west and witness this classic game.”

The 2026 AFL Origin game will be broadcast on Channel 7 and Fox, as well as 7Plus and Kayo streaming platforms, spotlighting Perth and its world-class sporting facilities to the rest of the nation.  

Further match details including tickets, match time, squads and more will be announced in the coming months. All event information will be available at Origin.AFL."

State versus State: Perth to host AFL Origin comeback

Perth has scored another historic Australian-exclusive event, with AFL Origin to return after 26 years on Saturday,14 February 2026 at Optus Stadium.

Perth set to host Australian-exclusive return of AFL Origin in 2026
Western Australian players to face off against Victorian counterparts
Iconic match expected to draw thousands of visitors to WA and inject millions into the visitor economy

Supported by the Cook Government through Tourism WA
Perth has scored another historic Australian-exclusive event, with AFL Origin to return after 26 years on Saturday,14 February 2026 at Optus Stadium.

Supported by the Cook Government through Tourism WA, the groundbreaking match will feature a top-tier team of WA AFL players, who will face off against their Victorian opponents.

The pre-season Valentine's Day match between WA and Victoria is expected to draw thousands of out-of-state visitors to WA.

Next year's match will also be the only AFL Origin fixture to take place in 2026 and the first interstate showdown since 1999, when South Australia and Victoria went head-to-head.

Originating in 1977, previous State of Origin matches proved hugely popular, with an attendance peak of over 91,000 fans at the MCG in 1989.

The 2026 AFL Origin game will be broadcast on Channel 7 and Fox, and streamed on 7Plus and Kayo, spotlighting Perth and its world-class sporting facilities to the rest of the nation.

AFL Origin is another example of the Cook Government's economic diversification strategy to attract a year-round events calendar to drive out-of-state visitation and generate valuable tourism dollars for local business and industry.

The match comes in addition to the two home games North Melbourne will play in Perth and Bunbury in 2026, as part of the Cook Government's growing partnership with the AFL.

That's an option, but that disrupts careful preparations for the H&A season by fitness & conditioning staff.

The fitness and conditioning team may not want players doing 'x' minutes on ground or some other condition but they're handing over control to a coach that will not necessarily respect their wishes and has no skin in the game ('the game' being home & away success).

>I think spice and frivolity are mutually exclusive. Like, a footy match cannot be both spicy and frivolous, can it?

Yes, frivolous meaning 'not having any serious purpose'.

The pre-season matches serve a serious purpose to gain match fitness and also evaluate and experiment with players in match conditions in preparation for the season proper.

Prestia was a top 10 pick already, and vice captain of the Suns. He was entering his prime, and despite injury interruptions, was a highly impressive player. Pick 6 isn't exactly breaking the bank.

The Cameron trade was three late first rounders, in exchange for GWS' leading goalkicker in every one of their seasons, who averaged 2.5 goals a game.

I would sell every organ in my body *entirely hypothetically and in an alternate universe* to encourage or ensure a Geelong or Carlton flag happened over a Hawthorn flag. 

In fact I would preference a Geelong threepeat followed by a Carlton threepeat, and then just for the comedy, an Essendon threepeat over a Hawthorn flag. 

Pretty much the only football related thing that I would not sacrifice in the effort of preventing Hawthorn from winning a flag is a guaranteed Saints flag (or twenty-seven, I certainly would not be complaining) within my lifetime. 

Yes, I do hate Hawthorn that much and am entirely that spiteful, petty and stubborn to say that the above to be true. 

Disclaimer: The last three paragraphs above are meant as a lighthearted joke and are not to be taken remotely seriously in regards to my dislike (and possible hatred) of Hawthorn. 

I would still definitely prefer a Geelong, Carlton or Essendon flag over a Hawthorn one though. 

I stand by what I said regarding the Saints flag (and my incredible abilities to be a spiteful, stubborn and petty woman, that are almost exclusively utilised when it comes to football and sports)."

If I had a gun to my head and I was forced I would choose Brisbane. I still have PTSD from the Geelong GF.  I hate Hawthorn, Collingwood is a given automatic oh fuck no and that leaves Brisbane.

Yes I should still harbour deep hate for the absolute bollocking they gave us in the GF but honestly, we played so badly that I think even North would have had a fair chance of winning that day, so no harm no foul to Brisbane. They just did their job.

Will I watch the GF?  I might watch the lead up and the start but will most likely clean out my spare room and check in every half an hour or so to see how its going. 

If Collingwood make it I will of course support their opponent but that doesn't mean I will care.  I might even play the 'drink when the commentators verbally gobble Daicos's knob' drinking game which could end in a very messy day but it would be better than being sober if they win"

Battle mumbled words to the effect of having the intention of staying and didn’t even tell the boys in the group chat until after he’d made the decision. If you’re gonna leave, leave, but don’t mill about making half hearted gestures about potentially staying. I don’t begrudge Battle for leaving, he left for a club with better chances of success and the club also was his childhood club which factors in big. But it was how he left that leaves a sour taste in Saints’ mouths."

The Storm only lasted two seasons, however, finishing second in 2014 and won the spoon in 2015. They continued with a development league side in the statewide league that rebranded themselves to the Prospect Hawks, in line with the Prospect Junior Football Club.   
Besides that, there is St Pat’s Old Collegians Football Club in NTFA Div 1 that represents West Launceston and there used to be a Prospect Hawks senior club that folded some years ago.

Having said that, during Merrett's time as Essendon, he's had to go through the drugs scandal and watch Dodoro draft poorly and/or the development team fail to grow players. Merrett almost never missed games and is regularly a star performer. At what point does Essendon have to face the consequences? 


Same thing happened to the Dees when Frawley went to Hawthorn, but we used the pick to get Brayshaw and turned the club around after that."

The first is that players just make a ton more money. Minimum salary in the NHL is US$750K, and it goes up from there. So having to suddenly move potentially from Vancouver to south Florida or vice versa is annoying, but it's not as much of a financial burden as it would be for a first year AFL player.

The second is the mix of history and legal structures. The big money is relatively new – lots of baseball players had offseason jobs into the 1980s. But player trades have been part of the fabric of American sports going back to the beginning, and baseball even has an antitrust exemption written in US law. Worker protections here are worse than our peer countries pretty much across the board, and even free agency only came about as a result of player unionization and solidarity. So by the time the money exploded, there was a well established foundation of teams controlling player movement but mollifying dissatisfaction with financial concessions. Today, players that reach free agency (and many never sign another contract after being drafted) might negotiate a no-trade clause, but typically the $$$ concession required there means only the biggest names can do it. In that case, you can control in the sense of vetoing a trade to a club you don't want to join, but you can't really force a trade without holding out and hoping the club blinks (e.g., Micah Parsons)."

Closer to 32% here on about $1 billion.

Yes it's big money at the top in AU but we're talking about a bigger cut of a massive pile of cash over there. Proper generational money.

People are forgetting he is 30. No 30 year old is worth a 1st round pick, let alone a top 10. Historically, the age ceiling for a top 10 pick is about 25.

We are also pretty early in a Premiership cycle - fans dont look much further than next season, but list managers almost always have 5 year plans... for a list built towards peaking 2028-2030, it doesnt make much sense for the Hawks to sell multiple assets which will be key in that window for a player passing their peak and who potentially doesnt even have 75 games left in them.

I see this going one of two ways:

* Essendon fans are left furious when he is traded out for far less than what people expect
* Essendon fans are left furious when he is still at the club at the end of the trade window 

FWIW, I think Essendon would be smartest to trawl the Hawks list for the next Josh P Kennedy... try and find the 22 year old with a shitload of potential, struggling for opportunities in the Hawks list, but could become an A+ with a change of scenery. A couple of players with potential, Carlton's 2nd round which we hold, and I think you have a deal which works... if the Essendon board can figure out how to sell that to the members. Hustwaite could be key - massive upside, destroying the VFL, but struggling to find a spot in the AFL team. Essendon are also reportedly interested in him. Chuck in the usual shuffling of junk time picks if you have to. Both clubs have NGA/F-S targets in 2026, but not sure if either club has targets in the 2027 draft which could also sweeten the pie.

Essendon also desperately need to be selling him on other clubs. If the Pies continue their strategy of torching any long term plan and trade going all in on a flag in 2026, that would be the best option if he wants both a flag and to stay in Vic.

Finally, Essendon need to be telling him to keep his mouth shut. As already mentioned, 30 year olds dont have trade currency no matter how good they are... if they are to have any hope of a first round pick for him, they really need him to stop devaluing whatever trade value he does have."

AFL players earn a relatively low portion of league revenue compared to other leagues, at 31.7%. A lot of other leagues are up around 50%, and I think the AFLPA would agree to free trading (with caveats) if the player's share was brought closer to that mark. Could also come with looser/earlier free agency eligibility, or special considerations (e.g. pay portion of salary outside of cap) for players drafted by the club.

Current CBA ends in 2027, if the trend continues then clubs may lobby for it during the next negotiation or the one after.

Don't think the trend is strong enough to justify just yet -- the cases are relatively few/isolated, and just last year we saw Melbourne hold onto Petracca under much more trying circumstances."

Dons obviously are going to ask for overs, but 3x first just wont happen so you either accept something less and still good like (2x firsts and a best 22 player for you)  or he stays which is fine too. I just don't think 3x firsts will come into play for a 30yo."

You get picked by AIG and have no choice or influence. A once great company which is now a bit of a shit show, a few scandals and fallen behind the rest of the industry. 


After a couple of years you sign a contract extension because you're not eligible to leave freely for several more years, potentially more than half way into your career. 


The year before you're eligible to leave AIG as a free agent the company throws a huge offer at you. Massive cash and promises you the role as department lead in a couple of years. 
The company is still struggling, but the draw of the money and the promotion makes it hard to say no. They promise to turn things around, things are going to change and be different and the vision seems to be reasonable. Plus your like you colleagues. 


Now you're 4/6 years into your new contract as the department head and you're miserable. The company didn't live up to it's promises and it's actually regressed in that time and bought in a new boss for the 6th time in your career. 


You're 3/4's through your career and the next couple of years are probably your last remaining chance to enjoy yourself. By the time this contract is up it's unlikely a new company will offer you anything meaningful in 2028 when you're past your prime. 


Naturally you regret signing such a long contract extension but you feel mislead by leadership at the company and effectively don't feel loyal to a place which hasn't lived up to it's promises. 


Are you telling me you'd just suck it up at that point and see out your career miserable at AIG? What do you owe AIG at that point to allow them to trade you to an even worse company so they can ""get value"" for you? Does that make you feel like a person or a commodity?"

The ultimate slap for Essendon would be if Hawthorn come up with a deal they are happy with but the Don's try holding out to the last day to hopefully get more, and then suddenly Hawthorn blindsides Essendon by doing a trade with somebody else. It wouldn't be the first time we have done that."

So we might have pulled rank on Daniher, but he only had a year on his contract whereas Merrett has two.

Go through the trade values for elite players with elite markets last 7 years May, Hogan to Freo, Jeremy Cameron, Taranto, Lachie Neale, Josh Dunkley, Jordan Dawson, Rankine, Houston, JHF, 

Now some of these players went for 2 1st round picks before say pick 14 like JHF but former no 1 pick makes sense

The only other players that went for 2 firsts or equivalent Dylan Shiel, Shai Bolton, Tim Kelly and Kelly and Shiel were huge overpays and Bolton TBD but even that was less than 2 top 10 picks and almost all these players were much younger than Merrett. 

I love Merrett but based upon those trades pick 8 and a second is more than fair, but I doubt hawks are compromising there future for a 30 year while elite still 30 year old mid, and I’m 99% sure Dees will accept that offer for Petracca and you’ll be stuck with a player who desperately wants to get out."

What counts as sufficient there? An ‘attempt’ might not actually result in any physical contact, or could just result in a player only just touching another player. Presumably those wouldn’t could as broken tackles since there’s not anything to break really. I assume the ‘attempted’ tackle needs to actually involve the tackler having some hold or control over the other player but that’s not actually what the definition says, technically."

The real money to be made isn't in selling seats, it's selling advertising space and TV rights. Because the amount of seats in a stadium is fixed and building/upgrading them requires actual physical material and labour, whereas the value of advertising is speculative and infinite, playing around with numbers that have no connection with reality.

  
Except those numbers do actually have connection to reality. The value of advertising comes from the amount of people watching. And that number doesn't simply go up because you add more games in the calendar. The amount of people who watch depends not only on supply, but demand. I.e, someones emotional investment to watch the game. 



It doesn't matter how free my weekend is, how empty my schedule is, or how desperate I am for ""content"". If it's a dead rubber game between bottom side teams, I'm not wasting my time. And if it's a training match in February, I'm just going to wait for the real footy to start. And even if I don't watch the game itself, the amount of media that pollutes my timeline and corrupts my algorithm decreases the hype for the start of the season. The more you fill the calendar with content, the less special footy becomes. And therefore the less I care about it.

  
My team has had an amazing year. I should be very happy about the footy. But the constant dopamine rush of social media, of discourse and rage baiting, has left me emotionally exhausted. These algorithms use up our emotional investment and drain us like batteries. It is a push for short term profit that harms the longevity of the game. These executives spend so much time looking at spreadsheets, that they're completely incapable of understanding what makes their product actually appealing."

State of Origin is a big deal in the NRL and they do it well but it’s not something we need to try and copy. The players aren’t going to play like their lives depend on it the same way they do in the NRL.

We need to stop worrying about what other codes are doing."

They might not watch the games, but many aren’t watching the NRL either. 

From my anecdotal experience, I think NRL isn’t really growing at all. It stays at its same level. While AFL is growing every year. We will see how that eventuates over the next 10-20 years.  The new Olympic stadium will massively grow the Lions base of active supporters who can easily get tickets and get to games with good public transport once the Cross River Rail opens."

Geelong Football Club don't want a final at Geelong unless there are three other finals in Melbourne and their opponent is non -Victorian and not as a tactical advantage for the team  but as an advantage to local supporters for when the stars align. They want as many Geelong supporters to watch as possible and that would be 40k at the MCG but 20k at Geelong if it was between Geel v Coll. That is why Chris Scott requests all home games in Geelong  during h&a but dismisses any questions about finals as it isn't beneficial to the supporters and doesn't provide much tactical benefit to the team (travelling to the MCG to watch is considered better than not getting a ticket).

Is your idea of fairness that Collingwood should be able to request to play our final against Brisbane at Adelaide Oval? That is the ground we play best and it would shoot Brisbane in the foot twice as they miss out on a game at the MCG.

The real equity issue is should the AFL lose revenue to allow teams to play at smaller stadiums when most of the home ground advantage is lost because both clubs' members have equal access to tickets? Should West Coast, Adelaide, Freo etc. get taxed more because one club wanted 45,000 spectators rather than 100,000 spectators at a final?"

Ok, here goes. If the Crows had won the Qualifying and Prelim finals this year, and Hawks had won through to the grand final on the other side of the draw, Crows would have had to play a final at Hawthorn's home ground. That's Crows (minor premiers) - Away, Hawks (8th) - Home. That's not a fair and equitable system. It's also obviously not fair for Vic non-MCG tenants... they never get to play finals at their home ground. MCG tenants are the privileged few of the AFL competition come finals time... it's just a fact!"

Western Bulldogs who finished 7th got to play at home in 2016 against Sydney in a GF.

If the MCG was like Wembley Stadium in England, and was a true neutral stadium, then there's no issue.

But all this whining by you, is just a waste of time. Not even proposing a solution, just pointing out the issue that we're all well aware of.

Like I said, only solution is remove shared stadiums, and leave MCG truly neutral by not allowing clubs use it for home and away games.

Can't see either happening."

Last year Bulldogs had to ""host"" us.

I completely understand the issue, I've raised it before as Melbourne clubs are basically MCG Hawks, Dockland Bulldogs etc as the clubs have relocated and given up ties to the suburbs/communities which they came from.

The only teams with true home grounds and advantages are the Qld and NSW teams.

Both WA and SA teams lose advantage when they play the other team, like that 2005 Semi Final I mentioned."

Lots happens in 2-3 years. Yeah he wants to win now, but we've had teams be struggling to granny's within that time frame, I highly doubt we would but it's weak effort.


We are seeing players manage to play on for longer, this is probably his peak but barring injury he should easily be able to play til 2030 at least at this high level.

Definitely, but I don't think it takes away from Merrett being a good Captain. He leads by example on the field, he plays anywhere he's told without issue. He's quite often the first player over to pick up his teammates when they are on the ground, or help break up fights. 

I think he's what we had needed the past few years in terms of a Captain. McGrath to me seems like a Heppell style of Captain, which is great, and I think that's what we need next, but the past couple of seasons where we've not been at our best, Merrett has been a great choice of Captain to really push everyone else."

I'm not saying it's the exact same situation -- Merrett certainly unfolded a little more sourly -- but Allen is still a CAPTAIN abandoning a side at the bottom for a chance at the top end of the ladder. 

The whole criticism here seems to be based on the fact that Merrett is Captain, has extra responsibilities and has bought in to the club for more.

Allen gets a pass because he's a free agent despite having the same responsibility? Or because he doesn't play for Essendon and isn't asking to go to Hawthorn?"

Certain clubs 100 years ago, North in the 70's, the richest (non subsidised) clubs are consistently competitive and the poorest aren't. 

This in my era we wouldn't have moved stuff, Adam Simpson won a flag in his first or second year playing, why would he have felt the urge to go and get a flag? You're a made man at his stage. He's probably not a captain for so long without that flag, it enhances his standing in the game.

I don't rate his behaviour, but Merrett retires quietly at Essendon, what's his legacy to the game? Do Essendon fans give two shits sbout him 10-20 years from now? Neutrals won't. It's okay for people to care about that rather than having blind faith.

He has based his value as a player entirely based on performance—when no one sees benefit in him being on an AFL list, he won’t be.  He’s still a prick, but at least there is some semblance of honesty in this approach.

Merrett, however, insisted on being valued as both a leader and a player.  His value as a leader is now in the toilet, which also affects his standing as a player.  

Leaders must be authentic—they need to be self-aware (imagine what this bullshit is doing to his teammates and club), have a strong moral compass (even during rough times), and be transparent in their relationships with their team and club (signing a long-term contract for a pay rise, demanding a trade the next year because they want to “win now”, and meeting with a fierce rival’s coach during finals week isn’t consistent with this).

He is now damaged goods and rival clubs will subsequently lowball Essendon in any trade negotiations.  Good trades are supposed to have mutual benefits, and it hard to see how Essendon will benefit under this scenario."

Requesting a trade to a club fans already hated for luring Callan Ward away. It truly was a bombshell as well. There wasn't even any noise about him being dissatisfied with the club. Bob Murphy says in his book that he was on holiday when he got the news. He was shocked and his heart sank. McCartney and Garlick resigning as a result and it appearing like the entire club was on fire also increased the vitriol aimed at Griffen.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing. We know it worked out far better for the dogs. Bevo, Boyd and a flag. That probably doesn't happen without the Griffen trade. Meanwhile GWS got 50 games out of him where he looked like a shell of his former self.
A lot of the anger towards him disappeared because of the way the trade worked out. But at the time the anger was as intense as I have ever seen. The feeling of betrayal is still there as well. 11 years on and he's probably the only former club captain that isn't overly welcome at the club."

- Jack Gunston, played 2 years, decided to leave for Hawks (a strong team). Didn't want to attend awards night. So he was stripped of his best young player award. 


I think it is because he showed so much promise, left to a premiership favourite, didn't want to attend awards night.


- Kurt Tippett, was highest paid on the list at the time. Had a clause on his contract that he could break the contract to return home to GC. Decided to leave for Sydney, tried to use that clause. Then showed Sydney that he had been paid dodgy. Sydney used as leverage. Then Crows missed out on the first round of draft picks for 3 years and 2nd round for 2 years.


Crows shouldn't have done it. But also throwing the club under the bus for leverage hurt everyone. Disliked for trying to force the club into the contract, then using that contract to force his way to the Swans.


- Jake Lever, he was at the Crows for 3 years. He slid on draft night due to injury. Went on for like 5 min about how he loves the club and wants to repay the faith in the club after his value had dropped when drafted. Had a great season in 2017 with Brian Taylor (a family friend of his) glazing over everything he did. Took a massive contract at the demons. Refused to go to the awards night (he was invited). Was seen throwing all his Crows stuff out at the tip (didn't donate it to charity or anything). Then through his dad started leaking stuff to the press to make Lever seem better. Most was false, easy to tell as it kept changing when more info came to light. Like that he wasn't invited to the awards night, or that the players didn't want him there (players were texting him to come).


Disliked because of how much he said he would repay the crows for selecting him on draft night, muck raking when leaving, and essentially being rude about the Crows.


- Contrary to popular belief, most Crows fans don't dislike players for leaving, see Jarryd Lyons, Ed Curnow, Patrick Dangerfield, Burnie Vince, Mitch McGovern, Shane McAdam, Charlie Cameron, Hugh Greenwood, Josh Jenkins, Eddie Betts, Phil Davis, Nathan Bock, and probably more I can't remember."

Take away all the sentimental stuff around AFL and what are you left with? Just a regular job, an employee working for an employer. And in that setup, what matters most? Job satisfaction.

So it makes perfect sense for a good player to want out if the club’s not performing. Why would you stick around in a joint where you’re constantly picking up the slack for blokes who aren’t pulling their weight?

Think of it like any other gig, say, a senior exec realising their company’s holding them back. If the only way to grow is to move on, then yeah, you’d start looking elsewhere. Footy or finance, it’s the same principle."

This is the flip side of that security.  

I remember when Carlton resigned Kouta way back in the 90s to a 5 year deal, it caused a bit of a kerfuffle because it was an unheard-of length.  

Contracts have been getting longer with 6 years becoming fairly common.  Especially in 2ns and 3rd contracts.

Merrett could easily have said we haven't had much success, I'm only signing a 2 year deal.  He wanted the security and he got. So did the club.  

I think Merretts main issue (and *Curnow's to an extent) is that he's signed a long term, front loader contract.  

Now with the new cap, and stkilda distorting the market, they look at average players getting more money than they are owed in 2026. It's making them want to be compensated to the degree they think they are worth.  

All of the rest of it is window dressing.

I reckon he had not had the terms of the contract altered for more money midway through, then this request would have been more palatable.

But he signed a contract, played a while, then asked for more money. Bombers have acquiesced to his demand and upped his renumeration.

In reality, given how much more manic and erratic he seems in interviews and on field these days, coupled with him having spent weeks in a psych ward, it is (or was) almost certainly some pretty severe stuff he was dealing with, the kind of thing that really impairs your judgment as to what is acceptable social behaviour. If people see a crazy homeless guy yelling at someone I think they don’t tend to think “what an asshole” they just assume that they’re acting erratically because of health issues beyond their control. I would extend that some courtesy here unless there was reason to believe otherwise.

Petoro providing direct quotes to media about Merrett's reasons for assessing his options 3. Leaking that he may not attend the BnF, it isn't stated if that's Merrett not wanting to go, or not being welcome.

Essendon has had players and coach publically disappointed in him. Other snr Essendon people upset with him and commenting on Mitchell as if he's done something wrong.

I guess some people are just too traditionalist about these things that think an employer is like a wife.

To me it doesn't matter if you are a captain, CEO, first year player, coach, massage thearapist, reception ,account or sales manager. There is nothing wrong with going for a job interview or talking to a recruiter, and there is nothing wrong with recruiting staff to your organisation.

The employee needs to do what's best for them and the recruiters need to do what's best for their organisation.

Edit: Oh and Petoro is also Brad Scott's manager. And Brad Scott walked out on Hawthorn to join Brisbane too so maybe he should think about his own commitments."

Even if it's true that he's fucking the club over, calling him out for doing so, while simultaneously saying you will not trade him is at cross purpose.

\- Nic Martin

""It's \[a feeling of\] disappointment that our captain, who is supposed to be leading us through this, is exploring other options.""

\- Mason Redman

“But the reality is that this time last year, we recommitted to Zach, we felt he was underpaid for someone who was performing at such a high level.

“So, for the second time in three years, we changed his remuneration to reflect his brilliant performance and his terrific leadership.

“We committed to him, he committed to us and like our CEO, who moved interstate and committed to the club, I came and made a commitment to the club, I intend to see my commitment through, and I expect our captain to do the same.”

\- Brad Scott

The Scott one here is a disguised ""he's being greedy"" and ""i've committed, the CEO has commited. Merrett isn't. He's betraying us""

That may be true, but saying it publically is making him an enemy of the club and turning fans against him.

It's also misleading to say Essendon felt he was underpaid and changed remuneration to reflect that. Reportedly they only did that because he was talking to StKilda and they went from 600k to 800k when Stkilda were offering 1.5Million. He's definitely worth 1mil a season and Essendon aren't full to the brim of talent that would be competing for that so why is he still underpaid compared to StKilda offers?"

The ""doing what he's doing, as captain"" I obviously have a differing opinion as I don't see a captain talking to other clubs and seeing what's on offer as anything wrong.

Wasn't the extension also in 2021? A lot has changed since then in the direction of the club, and even since Brad Scott starting in 2023 the vision has shifted from getting McKay and aiming for finals with 11 win season in 2023 and 2024 to now with many other players leaving, and the club looking to go to the draft again and potentially looking at bottom 4 for his 2 remaining years.

Again, even if he's objectively fucking over the club, if you want him to stay you play nice, if you want him gone sure make it known he's fucking over the club, but don't expect much in return if you've made it obvious you'd rather he was gone.

Also nothing wrong with scott being upset about recently giving him a pay rise and still wanting to leave.

This is why you'll notice it's a much better watch when one team has the white away guernseys and the other team has a colour.

It's a simple problem to fix leading up to the game. It's not as if anyone cares if the Sun's were wearing pink or not.

There was improvement last year but now we’re even worse. We had to start strong this year and we didn’t, and our 3 weeks after St Kilda next week are terrifying. We could genuinely be 0-9.

We are the worst coached team in a league that is developing very well tactically. We’re dreadful to watch.

Now it’s his sixth season as coach and we’re the worst team in the league. We’re the second oldest team and we have no semblance of defensive or offensive structure whatsoever.

Couple that with coaching decisions that would raise eyebrows in an under 14s team - playing our best defender Bec Miller in the forward line while we’re getting belted, keeping an undersized Kaitlyn Cox on possibly the best player in the league Chloe Molloy for an entire game, leaving genuine potential rising star chance Sierra Grieves out of the team for the first two weeks despite her already pretty much being in our top 5 players.

Between scrapping their VFLW team in COVID, to then axing the partnership with Port Melbourne VFLW this year, no real communication about the Sheerin trade, Yassir wanting out - and then not announcing Ferguson's resigning on their website, socials or in our email comms to members, instead just letting it quietly be announced by AFLW hoping it goes under the rug. All of it combined over recent years just leaves a bit of a bad feeling on the overall management

I think I'm just frustrated with the club's lack of communication on what the plans are to move forward, build depth, and improve. If Richmond had actually made a proper announcement and statement about Ferguson's signing and what the ambition is, I would feel much more confident for the future. Instead it feels like they're saying ""hopefully no one notices it asks us a question"""

We don't have the run coming from the back of the contest and I'm not sure if it's because other teams have figured out our stoppages or if we just don't have the players due to injuries to sustain it.

As much as I think Prespakis is one of our best players, the Saints seem to have her figured out when she's on the outside and I think that's the wrong place to have her anyway.

We looked awesome clearance wise when we had elite feed to the outside with Prespakis and Nanskewan working together in close, so I can't figure out why we aren't running that unless it's injury and workload related without more support for them both over the past 2 weeks."

This week I was hoping to see the run back, but in my opinion the injury toll is either too high or we haven't bounced back mentally.
Watching today the effort at least seemed much better, but Saints playing too well and we just didn't have the answers while down on rotations.

 Losing a pressure forward and having to play our full forward up the ground also isn't great for giving backs confidence to run off their players, and the Saints were generating spread on the back of their pressure all game and just did it much better today.

Honestly at this point when it comes to injuries as an essendon supporter I'm just numb, so analysis at least lets me try and see positives/understand logically rather than just feeling sad lol.

Edit: after today and because my grandfather was a Saints fan, I think St Kilda might be my second team in AFLW going forward. Great team performance with individual highlights was exciting to watch, and if sustained is a good model for success so hopefully you guys have some good results going forward"

Most clubs have some kind of test that you have to pass before being allowed to become a supporter.

For example, my club Melbourne has a charcuterie test. You need to place twelve different charcuterie items in their correct place on the board. There is some flexibility allowed, particularly if you display elite winter sports skills, but you should never ever mix your cheeses and meats.

Before becoming a Collingwood supporter, you'll need to have a dental exam. The dentist will sign a form confirming that you are missing at least one third of your teeth. They'll then put the form inside a locked car. If you manage to break into the car and get the form within sixty seconds, you're golden.

If you're interested in becoming an Essendon supporter, you'll be taken into a room and forced to watch the pawn shop scene from Pulp Fiction. Afterwards, you'll be asked ""If this was real life, which character from this scene would you like to be?"" Pick anyone but Bruce Willis and you'll be fine. Pick the gimp and you'll probably be given a lifetime membership on the spot.

St. Kilda has a skills test, I believe. If you can kick a footy further than 10m there's a good chance they'll offer you a playing contract for 2026.

Finally, I heard that Adelaide are updating their test for 2026. Something about a trip to San Francisco. Not really sure about the details.

tldr; Pick Tassie."

The AFL has equalisation measures in place to ensure that teams aren't indefinitely dominant or indefinitely shit. All teams have their periods of being good/bad, and watching your bad team slowly grow to become good is really satisfying. So you don't really need to worry about picking a strong team that wins a lot."

Collingwood are the big BIG team of the competition - think New England Patriots, Manchester City, Barcelona FC or the New Zealand All Blacks. You'd have no problem supporting them and getting success but they are universally hated as a result.

If you want something similar but without as much universal despise, something like Geelong (always plays finals), Sydney Swans (consistently pops up for a grand final) or Richmond (massive club and just finished a 3 premierships dynasty) is a better shout.

Collingwood (Pies) have a huge fanbase, the second largest to the Swans, so you'll have company that's for sure. They're the popular ones.

Collingwood are considered a good team, they're recent grand final winners and they're into the semi finals this year, so you shouldn't have to worry about them being knocked out of the ladder too early (at least for now).

Collingwood are based in Melbourne, so if you're not Melbourne based or you're in another state, you might not have as many opportunities to watch them play on home soil, or you might not have as many local comrades if you're backing Collingwood over your local team - take it from me a Pies supporter in Sydney 😂

Collingwood have a reputation for inconsistent and nail-biter games. My friends and I joke that Collingwood will enter the final quarter 40 points ahead and somehow manage to just squeak by. They love to be super far behind and make huge comebacks, or be leading by a mile and fumble it. They're not for the faint of heart! (Swans also have a reputation of dominating the ladder then fumbling it at the very end).

Collingwood are direct rivals with Carlton and Richmond, so if you for some reason enjoy those two teams or live in those suburbs, Collingwood might not be the team for you. I've gotten mean looks walking around Carlton with a Collingwood gersey on.

Collingwood's star player is Bobby Hill, if there's something about Bobby Hill you don't like you'll struggle to fit in because he is God to Collingwood fans.

And lastly, as I mentioned, Collingwood have a huge fanbase, so if you're looking to root for the underdog or a smaller team, then they wouldn't be for you.

But overall, AFL is a very peaceful and respectful sport, there's no ""bad"" team or malice between teams and fans. You're never going to be cast out for supporting any one particular team. Welcome to the AFL family!"

While their team got cast as flattrack bullies it was a pretty damn rude position for them to end up in at the end of the year. Was just competitive in a bonkers way amongst all the top end teams and will probably be exactly the same next season.

In a league like the AFL this isn't supposed to happen and it annoys everyone else. Every clubs have ups and downs but not Geelong, or at least the downs are very minor and short-lived. 

There's also a bit of a perception that they have it easier compared to everyone else. They're the only Victorian team that gets to be Victorian (so less travel required) and also have a strong home ground advantage. But there are legit drawbacks to this as well so idk.

Also got incredibly fortunate with father-son draftees (Ablett, Hawkins, Scarlett) which they built a dynasty around and haven't looked back. Everything seems to go right for Geelong.

I'm not sure why we keep getting linked to him as Mac and Scotty have both said there is not strong interest in him. 

We have two amazing up and coming ruckman that will be extremely important to us. Toby Conway is probably the most important player under 10 games in our team, he bet English, Xerri, Nankervis and McInerney in his first 6 games, admittedly with fades out in the 4th quarter. But he will be an Al Australian ruckman eventually and the club talk about his upside all the time."

""Adelaide is set to be “one of the most aggressive” in the chase for Brisbane’s Zac Bailey, per a report from The Age.


Bailey, who won his maiden All-Australian blazer, shapes as one of the most in-demand pre-agents for 2026 alongside the likes of Zak Butters, Sam Walsh and Ben King.


It comes after Essendon was said to be preparing a lucrative $8 million offer across six years to the Norwood product, which prospectively make him the highest-paid player in club history.""

Tbh I think all of this stuff is sorted if they do these two things + alternative bonus

A) You can't get a father son, free agent, or academy player if you finished top 8, ergo a top side has to trade to get access to these benefits and the bottom sides get the trade value.

B) Any Academy/NGA drafted gets a monetary salary cap benefit to the original club so that the so called incentive isn't taken away (even though the point of them isn't to make clubs better but to grow the game - but this noble intention has been maliciously hijacked and distorted).

C) If you as a fan are insistent on top clubs getting free assets, then ignore my first two points and all clubs outside of finals should get more draft picks (they all pick twice before a top 8 side even starts drafting) so that the lower teams have more assets to lift themselves up quicker."

Have followed Bec's journey from her Footy Show hosting days. Initially, I was content with the pioneering in the daring to be different approach within this industry.
However, it did not take me and my girlfriend collectively long to establish a dislike towards her ability to interact with cohosts and players. I have not seen much of her since those days, I somewhat established her lack of presence and engagement with ANYONE sort of spoke for itself and she was gradually extinguished from that role.
Yes, I have known she has had other hosting roles within networks and I cannot comment on the quality of this as I have not seen it. ... BUT ….. my god. She talks over other presenters. She speaks louder than others to try and attain a dominant voice within the interview. She asks the absolute worst unscripted questions to the players. She buts in when the player is mid sentence. She runs with a joke that she herself laughs at and 99 times of 100 it is just not funny - and it's just unmitigated cringe on so many levels on the players behalf and the fellow presenters. The other presenters have to sort of look at each other and try and work out a way to rectify the conversation- and they obviously do, and make it work.
But boy oh boy, wow wee, how does this lady get a job when she adds absolutely nothing at all. I feel it's unnecessary to compare her to other female journalists/ presenters in the industry because it is on a complete and utter, unprecedented different level than what Rebecca is on. Sorry, just a rant. And a long term observation on this obnoxious being. Another reason Foxtel commentary wins on so many facets."

Nor is that what it's designed for.

What it can and should do is stop clubs being able to *both* generate the points *and* kick the pick into the future. In 2023, Gold Coast had pick 4. They turned that into points for their academy players, Bulldogs' 2024 1st, and a North end of first round priority pick. 

I think it works out that in between 2023 and 2024, they turned their own picks, Lukosius and of course Rory Atkins into Walter, Read, Rogers, Graham, Lombard, Noble, Rioli, and Collingwood's and Port's 2025 1sts.

X is our most important player all round tho, not sure where we'd be without the big man, still think he deserved AA ruckman but he will hopefully lock his spot in the AA over the coming years. 

Who votes for these btw? Is it Clarko and the other coaches or just Clarko?    
A few interesting players being higher in the count than i expected like Daniel but its interesting to see the votes as you get a read on what the coaches (if thats who is voting), find important to the team and play their role as asked.   
Its obviously very different to how the fans and armchair experts view the teams and individual performances"

2 – Played your role with influence

In all seriousness though, comparing to 90's bnfs is a bit of a silly thing to do. Compare the current brownlow medal voting to then, its changed too. Players were winning brownlows off being best on for only 4 games back then, now its like 12 best ons. 

  
Also not really a bad thing having 1 player be the constant winner if they're the out and out best. 

Collingwood had pendles win it on repeat for a bit there, and dane swan before that. 

Don't think having a single player be out and out best and winning b&fs inherently means the rest of the team is mediocre."

Collingwood, better than the other two and want Membrey to win a flag as well.

Geelong, *vomits* as at least if they win then we don't have to pay them money as a bonus + Jeremy Cameron being a good fella, so can cheer for him. It is begrudgingly done though, and I would have chosen almost any other team in the competition ahead of them.

Hawthorn, have to pay them more money if they win due to the Tassie sponsorship. They are annoying and stole Battle. Also, Clarko made little kid me cry at a Hawthorn event in like 2014/2015, so fuck him and fuck Hawthorn too."

She moved interstate just before the 2015 GF, shortly before this incident.

It was after a meet the players thing and I was approaching the queue to meet the players. I was like  five metres away from the (mostly see through) barrier and had a Hawthorn scarf on. Clarko ignored me and told players to get back on the bus (I think one or two players may have objected, but can't recall for sure, or who they may have been). The bus sped away leaving me there devastated. 

They had happily signed stuff for some other groups waiting for the bus, so it wasn't super unreasonable to think I had a chance. And also, if Clarko had said something like 'Sorry, we really need to go, so we can't sign or meet you' it would probably have still hurt, but been more understandable, especially as we were the last group in that little queue.

Didn't help my little kid emotions that a classmate was also there ahead of me and proceeded to wave his signed poster in my face and gloated about it.

Now, as an adult, I understand that they probably needed to catch a flight, but it hurt as a kid and that combined with the loss of my friend to watch games with meant I didn't actively support Hawthorn in 2016. 

Then, the classmate used the signed poster to bully me for 18 months until he moved schools (for family reasons), killed any remaining passion left for supporting Hawthorn. Probably also laid the foundations of my now hatred for them (if I'm preferencing Geelong above them, dispite growing up in an *anybody but Geelong household*, then it is hatred/loathing). 

Sorry for the essay, it clearly is a wound that hasn't quite healed, leading to a solid rant."

Straight sets in 19 and 21, flogged in the prelims in 20 and 22. I think it’s a testament to Fagan’s coaching that he had a team of great young talent over performing a little early and doing well in the H&A season, but we weren’t ready for finals yet. 

Everyone knew those 19-22 Lions were inexperienced and mentally weak, we choked so many games and were really bad at controlling games and fighting against momentum. We’ve only really been in the window for real since 2023 imo."

20 you were definitely contenders, and were favourites after beating us in the QF. I remember all the talk at the time was that the Lions had broken their hoodoo and would be almost impossible to stop with the finals series at the Gabba, then they just inexplicably didn’t show up at all in the prelim. 

21 and 22 they felt a step behind the best I agree. 

But still in the last 7 years the record is 1 flag, 2 GFs, 5 PFs and the only two you missed were by less than a kick. 

I like the Lions generally (I live in Brisbane and my mum and my girlfriend are Lions fans) but it does get a bit boring just seeing them there over and over. I like new teams on the block, makes it more exciting to me."

Even if two players went for it and the person who didn't control the ball must have touched it and quite likely touched it first they'll usually pay the mark to whoever manages to extract it. I remember one from a recent Derby, the Eagles player went for the chest mark but it bobbled up, Luke Ryan came from the front and punched the ball but only punched the ball into the chest of the Eagles player who grabbed and held it. That was called a mark. 
One factor would be how hard it would be to spot a proper effective touch to it. Whilst replays from a certain angle might show a clear touch, from other angles (like the one the ump had) it might not be so obvious."

If your club isn’t right off field (Essendon, Carlton, Eagles e.t.c) you simply aren’t going to compete at the optimum level.

Obviously there are other factors - northern academies, fixture decisions, and the plethora of AFL decisions driven by what appears to be an overwhelming finance driven set of priorities.  I think “fairness” is only considered to the degree it would be perceived to impact negatively on income.

I would say a decent chunk of it comes down to how those clubs are run off the field and the stability in those periods. Brisbane, Hawthorn, Collingwood and Sydney have all had years in the bottom 4 in the last decade but are well-run enough to rebuild quickly, with Geelong a ‘mini-rebuild’ (missing finals once on two occasions) 

Where the AFL has failed to make the competition even comes down to the draw and its flow on effects. More so for Collingwood & Geelong and a lesser extent hawthorn. Those two clubs get a fixture that gets them 2/3 more wins per year (the diff between top 4 & top 8) through no travel to Tassie, Darwin, Canberra etc. Compare how many grounds the bulldogs, GWS, GC, Freo play at during the season. Not only does it get them more wins, it provides an uneven advantage when it comes to trading and free agency as the big crowd/game factor is a key pillar of the negotiations. This has a snowball effect with memberships, crowd, game times, and so on and so on making it difficult for the smaller Melbourne clubs and some interstate sides."

If you’d told me in 2001 that Geelong and Sydney would be two of the dominant teams of the next 20 years and that Essendon and North Melbourne would be two of the worst performed teams I’d have laughed you out of the room. 

But the Bombers and the Roos in particular have been victims of poor draft choices, poor management, poor decisions off-field. The AFL can only do so much. 

A team like the Tigers are great example of different management strategies. They’ve finished on top once on this period, only played five prelims, but won three flags - one fewer than the Cats, Lions and Hawks but one more than the Magpies. And now they’re on the way down again. 

The Lions? They were a laughing stock less than a decade ago. The Hawks? They haven’t won a flag in a decade. 

And there’s teams like the Power who should have won a flag with a little more luck. The Blues and the Demons, who are a mix of unlucky and poor management. 

I just think it’s a very simple way to look at things to say that equalisation doesn’t work."

* Power brokers in the club, including Sheedy, conspired for years to try to get Hird back into the position of head coach

Seriously though, seemed AFL were punishing Sydney at the time for taking advantage of systems they had in place at the time to attempt ""equality"" for teams that were at a disadvantage (free agency and COLA).

Since then, we've seen free agency benefit top teams more and more, and struggling teams with ""war chests"" unable to lure big fish - then eventually overpaying for B grade players as it's the best they can do with the money.At the same time, they lose their own players to free agency, often being ""over-compensated"" with high end draft picks (ie. Theyre incentivised to give up key players).

On the player end - free agency does more for top players than it does for fringe players. Top players line up their contracts with free agency, their agents shop them around (usually to the clubs with war chests), leak rumours to the press, then sign to their existing club at a premium, or go wherever they want without having to be party to a trade to compensate their existing club. ""Restricted"" free agency is a load of crap, teams so rarely match offers for players fhat have publicly said they want out and have large contracts in front of them (often manipulated in ways that make them hard to match).

So free agency, whilst has some benefits for players in getting to where they want, and for competing teams to plug holes in their lists, is absolutely not an eqalualisation tool."

Collingwood is great but look at their drafting the past 10 years.

For context, the linked picture is a list of the Browns starting QBs since their return to the NFL in 1999 (up to 2023, a couple more names would have been added last season); the closest comparison I can make is this would be like putting an AFL team's captains on the same jumper over the years, with one team's jumper having a list more than twice as long as everyone else's.

Having those advantages makes having a well run club easier as you have to make fewer compromises. We've seen that the smallest advantages can make large differences in footy.

Culture building is also extremely important. 15 prelims in 20 years is absurd even with a supposed leg up on other clubs in the trade period. 

Most impressively Geelong are incredible at finding good picks and developing them, or developing players in general. Guys like Atkins, Mannagh are diamond in the rough that they continually seem to add. I would imagine this keeps their salary cap down decently for periods at a time.

So when people yell on about Cotton on cash & farms it all seems a bit silly to me. The fact of the matter is only a handful of clubs manage themselves on the same level. Geelong have basically been the San Antonio Spurs in the Tim Duncan era."

Prolonged elite level drafting in the mid 2010s, with excellent early trade success in 17 (Cameron), 18 (Neale, McCarthy), and 20 (Daniher) were far more instrumental to our 7 straight finals campaigns than Ashcroft, Dunkley or Fletcher have been (as amazing as they all are, and certainly could be attributed for the final step last year).

Our 2017 draft haul was incredible - Rayner, Bailey, Starcevich, Payne.

That added to previous seasons of McCluggage, Berry, Andrews, and Hipwood. Keeping Lester around for him to become an A-grader in his 30s and taking a punt on Zorko were also instrumental.

Our team is as good as it is now because of the road we took from 2019-2022. We were what Adelaide are now."

With the academy, it all originates from hard work. Getting players to choose to stay in Queensland and not go to Victorian clubs, we always face a challenge to get kids to stay with AFL instead of NRL, there's so many many other factors that people don't consider. "

Actually that's a good point, I remember when the Saints played an away game against Melbourne this year, they travelled to Alice Springs. If it were Collingwood instead, that game would be at the MCG.

Which means in those 25 seasons we've either doubled up or been sent to Geelong 20 times. That's a disadvantage, no matter how well run we are. In fact from 09-17 we had 1 home game v Geelong.

And the fixture is full of shit like this by the way. This is by no means the only example. 

My point is that the fixture is low hanging fruit that can be very quickly equalised to ensure a fairer competition. 


As for 2021... do we win in the last round at kardinia park if there was a crowd? Do we then win a flag from 3rd? In that no covid universe playing that away game v Geelong at the mcg would have been very handy."

Id also make it so teams can't play 3 home games v another in a row. Finals not counted obviously. 

Yes, we would have been at KP in 2021 regardless. But Collingwood wouldn't have been. 

And I get your point about a single fixture but this is happening to clubs all the time. Hey freo, go play the hawks in tassie where you can't get a direct flight. Its built in so the ""smaller"" clubs get shafted, which makes it harder for them to climb up/peak."

Cats were definitely (unintentionally) helped this year by a weaker fixture with a tight end of the season. Let the club get primed while most everyone else in the eight had to slug it out hard with how tight it was.

There are a few way it has been done but I think inevitably it ends up creating problems that can be easily avoided with single round robin which also allows the season to have a mid season break for Origin or something."

The AFL was in a rush to make this an 18 team comp and they didn’t once consider that maybe there isn’t enough good players to make it one. 

Couple that with the AFL for decades ignoring the fact women’s footy even existed then tried to take all the plaudits when they made a national comp.

Not to mention the fact they can’t offer decent money to make them actually train and play full time. 

I’m not blaming the players I’m blaming the AFL."

As at round 5 in the men’s, 3 teams had percentages in the same range.

And that’s despite the percentages in the women’s game being wider in disparity because they score less (largely contributed to by playing a lot less time).  Denominators have a greater impact then numerators in determining percentages.  It just looks worse than it is.

This week Marnie Vinall spoke at length about the problem of the fundamental difference in standards between some of the clubs. And just now on AFLW on Fox the hosts were saying it’s getting to the stage where the AFL might have to step in to do something about the imbalance of the competition.

But apparently, they are all going on about nothing."

Let’s not pretend like the AFL are let the worst overreactors going around. Fox hosts saying the AFL might have to step in…by doing what? Priority picks?  Where have I heard that before.  

Every year more athletic, more skilled, taller, stronger young women come into the comp via the draft.  When the comp started, most athletic, talented teenage girls played netball, basketball or both, not footy.  Now they play footy as well - often all 3.  No surprise the skills are going up and scoring is going up.  There’s viral footage going around of an under 16 ‘s girl exploding out of a centre clearance, 2 bounces, goal from 55 out.  What are we worrying about again?

At the same time the club’s football programs get better and better.  North is the pace setter in this regard but every other club is watching what they’re doing. Our cliff will come when our key players (who are mostly in their 30’s) retire.  And we’re seeing results across the board that show the comp is pretty even - the Saints (1 win before today) just flogged Essendon (3 wins before today) playing a great style of footy. Pies handed The Swans their first loss. Port beat the Dees who are one of the flag favourites.  6 of the top 9 teams lost this weekend. And so on.  

The comp is doing good and getting better."

Yes, we all love the AFLW and want it to be great, but it doesn’t mean everything is perfect and that serious people are not allowed to talk about the issues that hurt the development of the comp.

As Marnie (one of the most respected AFLW media there is) talked about at length on The Footy podcast this week, there is clearly a massive difference between the professionalism and standards of some of the clubs. It’s incredibly difficult to grow a new competition when some of the clubs are taking it seriously, but some are very obviously just phoning it in."

Honestly, it’s been his forte for years. In the later years at Freo he lightened defence for more of a running game, but our defence during those years was pretty good, good enough that RTB said with our defence, if we could kick 100 points we’d win every game."

He also backs players in when they're having off-seasons, hoping they can surface some gem moments. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but he backs them in. This is where our comeback games have come from, belief in the players they can get the job done.

On-field style is dynamic, territory kicking. They have adjusted, but generally that is the game style."

He has stated many times that the fastest way to move a football is to kick it. So his philosophy is based on balancing that control and aggression with kicking decisions. 

For a few years we were a much more controlled kicking team, defending by lots of sideways kicking. 

But recently we have used kicking as a form of aggression, mainly due to Dayne Zorko. 

That's in contrast to some run and handball teams, GWS and peak Richmond come to mind."

There’s some finder detail but those are the three hallmarks of what we saw in 2025.

This is a disaster if you miss a kick or hand pass on transition, as your defence is too high up the ground and your midfield needs to fold back to help.

And as much as I liked that a team has jumped on a genuinely different type of colour for their clash, having Red home and then Pink as your clash, is just asking for this issue. 

My main gripe isn't that it's been approved, it's why is it approved this week? When the Suns release this, the AFL should have a check for vs. Lions at home and away and know what the guernseys should be.  It should be agreed in February, not September.

I know I sound borderline Warren Tredrea like here but essentially, Port Magpies from the SANFL pre 97 is the same club and always has been. The one club merger was just about having consistency in the reserves"

For instance, Robert Lewandowski wanted to leave Dortmund for Bayern, even had an agreement with Dortmund to do so. Bayern put in the transfer bid, and Dortmund refused it and wouldn't let him leave. Lewa played his normal season and left when his contract expired the season after. 

Soccer also gets the benefit of release clauses (Mandatory in Spain), which means that players can sign a contract for, say, 5 years but if a club puts an offer in to sign them for that release clause price, the club can't reject it."

The pre finals bye helps your first two opponents the same as it helps the team 5-8.

The top 4 opponent has to win only 1 of 2, and plays the second at home against a lower ranked opponent.

it’s probably strange seeing this first attempt from us as the hawks are one of the pioneers of dumping memes on their Instagram wall and are very good at it. 

I was thinking the fanbase might’ve reacted poorly to it but they seem to be getting around it in the comment section so let a thousand blossoms bloom I guess - must be fresh for them.

Relative to other teams we’d have some of the lowest engagement on posts and I think they would’ve discussed that.

Gotta try something I guess?

There isn't just one bloke who is the sole admin and everything to them is a pisstake. This is a top-level team for the largest sport in the country. And when people see posts like this they can see it as lowbrow, effortless, easy. But that disregards the collective effort the entire digital marketing team a club would have puts in.   
None of these clubs are purely posting memes, Hawthorn and Essendon post some real quality stuff that clearly takes a lot of time and skill to craft. They should be allowed to post light-hearted stuff like this every now and then, because they're always going to be posting other content that gives a good insight into the club.  
 
I think what it boils down to is people don't want to feel like a corporation is talking down to them, but rather individuals. It particularly works well for Hawthorn because just like their players, their social team is trying to inject some personality into the brand too.   
  
Not everyone will agree but I see the craft as more than just memes and tiktok dances."

A bit of work to do from Sydney in the second half to get back into it. It's only 5 goals so not insurmountable by any means, but if we can't claw back at least two goals in the third, we won't have a chance to win.

The players have gone into their shell a bit. Hesitating so Collingwood can go back and clog up any leads and slow it up. The forwards' pressure is really poor too - it's coming back out way too easily. Full credit to the Magpies, they're playing a hell of a game so far."

Sheedy wouldn’t move on.  We missed Hardwick and Bomber as senior coaches - both led brilliant teams.

We had a list manager who might have seen talent, but overrated draft picks to get it on a trade and when he did trade draft picks missed a great draft.(missing Bobby Hill, Josh Dunkley, but then trading in Shiel for 2 firsts), didn’t know how to be ruthless on contracts.   So so players have had 7-10 year careers.

Squandered some elite father son talent(Daniher) and persisted with some that weren’t going to make it(take your pick).

The deck is clear.   Merrett is just the last fed up player with the above.

The new setup is now properly professional and will get the job done.  It’s just a hard bloody road because of it.

The AFL intervened up in Brisbane because you wouldn’t have survived 20 plus years of shitness.   QLD footy was dire 8 years ago - it’s blossoming now.  "

It really doesn't reduce what we might be able to get at all. We don't want anything. If Hawks are extremely keen on signing Merrett, they'll keep coming back with more offers until one of them makes Essendon pause to think.

Mark McKenzie is in charge of those decisions so blaming Sam just further bolsters my belief that there is an agenda at play here. If Sam didn’t give a fuck about any working relationships (again, going against the literal cornerstone of offseason list management) he would be alienating himself from the list management team at hawthorn, and the board who also contribute to key footballing decisions. It just wouldn’t work, no ifs buts or maybes.  

> Mitchell has sold Merrett on a dream

If it wasn’t us, it would’ve been Collingwood or Bulldogs. And we would have the same reaction as Essendon are a shitshow. Do you believe that Sam is working magic by being the only person that can cause this reaction to occur?

And the same reason Oscar Allen didn’t work can still be the reason why Zach Merrett doesn’t work now. Someone can still come in and offer bigger money, nothing is set in stone yet. So why damage their reputation by starting this over a dice roll?"

Meanwhile Carlton don't have those solid young players (Smith may be good but everyone seems to think he's the saviour which I think is dangerous), plus most of their key players are in their late 20s, and by FAR the best on the team, so with them either ageing out or getting traded their prospects look grim.

Absolute joke.

I’d describe our club as a rabble but that is being overly kind.

They are making a rabble look good.

The silver lining perhaps is maybe Zach Merrett is actually a shit bloke off field.   And despite being very good may actually have been the problem preventing the club getting out of its 20 year malaise.

Scott clearly doesn't want Merrett to go, the board are backing him on that, and I imagine others in the football department are on the same lines.

At this point, Merrett only wants to leave for Hawks, so if Hawthorn really want him, they are going to have to offer up something that'll make it very hard for Essendon to say no to.

I was told in a previous reddit post that there is conscious push for teams to drastically improve their performance during the finals campaign. Geelong have been the pioneers of this trend. It appears other teams are beginning to take notes (Col,Haw). '24 swans proved the premiership is not won in the beginning/mid-way point of the season. Having such a win at all costs mindset could even prove detrimental to ones chances (more risk of injuries). To add to the unpredictability, when looking solely at your graphic one can make a strong case  for lions against GC tonight. Though many people fancy the youth of GC to get the job done."

You have win rates ranging from 30% - 67%, and a percentage gap of 20% between the best and the worst (roughly the same gap as the regular ladder). I just don't really get what you're driving at...

Also, just as a side note, I think this ladder would have been better ranked by win% than total wins. Brisbane has 7 wins from 11 games (64%) and GWS has 6 wins from 9 games (67%), but you've got Brisbane ahead. Similarly, you've got Adelaide at 5-5 ahead of Freo at 5-3.

We've blooded a heap of new talent, made a fair few changes on the run, had Bont and Darcy out for significant stretches, no Cody, Treloar or JUH, and still won 14 games.

Spend loads of draft picks on an older player (Gibbs) to get us over the line. Then do a camp to help our mental side of the game by employing life coaches who believe in horoscopes and have never held down a normal job.


Then when people complain, socially isolate them so they get with the program.

Most of us look at 2022 as a pretty successful season as we went from 17th to 4th and a kick away from beating both grand finalists. Didn't win the flag but success is subjective and relative. 2011 we almost collectively view as the black spot - losing the GF in fairly comprehensive fashion and the Malthouse-Buckley debacle... that season (totally of the club's own doing) robbed us of a possible premiership dynasty.

And it's game that doesn't have to happen, so the coaches could vote and say, no wildcard this year, Hawks deserve 8th spot, they don't have to defend it. 


But let's say there is a year where 9th just misses out, but 8th was gifted an easy draw, the coaches could vote for I wild card game, or say a team has shocking injuries first 8 games, then comes storming home but misses on finals due to a bad luck start.

Played 5 games against the bottom 3 teams and 2 against Port, 1 of which was when Port was a basket case. Kind run with injuries when compared to the sides around them. Extra game at home due to gather round. Of the 4 top 8 teams they played once, only Fremantle was away from Adelaide.

They didn't beat a top 8 side outside of Adelaide. Inaccurate kicking cost Brisbane, Collingwood dominated the game in Adelaide but couldn't put it on the scoreboard due to their lack of composure going forward. Hawthorn over possessed the ball and kept turning the ball over as the result of going for the extra release handball and putting themselves under more pressure until they turned it over.

Compare that to Hawthorn that only played 3 games against the bottom 3 sides and have had a lot of their best players out of form at various parts of the year. The only 3 of Hawthorn's higher end players you could say have had a consistently good year were the 3 that made the All Australian Team. Of the 4 top 8 sides that Hawthorn played once, only their game against Geelong was in Melbourne or Tasmania. Their 3 double up games they played against the top 8 sides were all top 4 sides. Adelaide's were against 4th, 7th, and 8th.

8th beating 1st really isn't that surprising when you consider that this is the weakest 1st and strongest 8th placed teams we've had in the AFL era."

To the Adelaide staff and board, the last four weeks have been the absolute fucking worst. You have zero clue how to handle yourselves and have actively hurt many supporters with your actions. The Crows need to lead the league not only on the field but off the field - we've shown exactly what not to do. Immediately get into talks for a AFL Mens Pride Game and start showing some spine.

I hope the crows take the time become a team that can compete strong in the midfield, I hope the coaching staff proves me wrong and shows they can make us into a team that can win a flag, but I doubt them. 

Also maybe the club could learn to handle players saying slurs with like, a basic level of PR competence. Also don't say slurs. That would be nice"

He is just one player and the margins were too big to point to him as the sole deciding factor. I do think that Adelaide’s actions and the media response to their actions seriously hurt the cohesion of the playing group and that is where the majority of  blame should lie for the end of their year. This is not to say what Rankine did wasn’t incredibly stupid.
 
I think the non-weirdo Crows fans can still hold their head high after this year. It’s been a fantastic storm up the ladder from last year and they’ve really established themselves. I do hope the club sorts out its culture issues over the break."

To be fair, it was their first finals series. It will be a learning opportunity. I hardly recall many clubs having success in their first finals campaign after a long hiatus, and with how close this year was, anyone could've won it.

They will come back next year likely better."

With Adelaide though, I really don’t think any club at the organisational level would’ve handled it as poorly as the Crows did. Given how prominent AFL gay rights have been over the last month even outside of the Rankine incident - discourse around Snoop Dogg, Mitch Brown - Adelaide managed to miss every single chance to rehab their image. It’s like they didn’t even think the process of *cynically* projecting support for gay rights was worth the effort. You’ve basically signalled to the supporter base that the club doesn’t care about gay people, which emboldens some supporters to act more feral. And then the nail in the coffin is not calling a spade a spade after last week and instead hoping people will forget this whole thing once it’s out of the news cycle. I just don’t think any other club would’ve have blundered their messaging at every possible stage and I think it truly does reflect, at best, institutional indifference to gay rights in sports, which is also disappointing considering the gay representation in the Crows women’s team. 

The whole thing is a PR shitshow that could be studied and now Adelaide are gonna be branded as the homophobic club (which given all this isn’t really unfair). And to think it all started because they went too hard defending a player at the tribunal so he might be able to play finals, for this situation to ultimately derail their energy which fucked them for finals anyway."

What annoyed me most this game was the lack of courage to take the game on. They kept kicking it long down the line in hope.of a mark that never came but didn't think to switch to something else. And as soon as there was any pressure on a Crows player, they crumbled. Keeping Keane on Gunston all game was criminal.

Most people didn’t pay attention to this but the Crows form was already waning in the lead up to finals. They had a blistering run of about ten rounds to go top. Then they had three extremely underwhelming wins to finish the season. They basically fell in against West Coast (the worst team in modern history), managed to beat a Collingwood team at home that had been running on empty for two months, then finished with a 13 point win over North. Then the angst and controversy over the Rankine decision made their off field focus a distraction while on field they were missing their most potent X factor performer.

So really, straight sets seems like a natural consequence of their ladder position being inflated by a good block of form."

Rankine’s absence hurt them as much as it possibly could but even with him in the side I don’t think they could’ve won.

They were set up to be a _minor-premier-out-in-straight-sets_ by their draw alone. Rankine out was just the cherry on top. Adelaide had a weak draw and possibly meeting good clubs when they were down a bit. Adelaide were truly set up to fall from a great height and fail.

As for North Melbourne in 1983, they played everyone twice, as did all other 11 clubs, so had no excuse. With our skewed draw favouring clubs that finish low, any club can suddenly rise and go to the top - look at North again: 1976 and 1977, but that was done through massive recruiting alone, not a skewed draw. St Kilda looks a candidate for a rise, through both recruiting and a good draw next year, especially if they finished 13th or worse, but because that recruiting _is_ involved, it may mean a good September, not a Crows one!"

I used to hate Collingwood w when I was growing up but after the way Taylor Walker behaved with his pathetic lack of sportsmanship during his speech post match when we won the 2017 premiership made me hate them more than I ever hated Collingwood. That they completely imploded as a club was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my 62 years and I'm hoping that this meek exit will get into their heads and have the same effect cause there's nothing better than seeing  the Adelaide Crows in disarray.

I could not believe the sour fans around me saying they'd rather lose by ten goals than a point. 

It was a great game of football, we fucked up, we fixed it, we fucked up again. It could easily have gone our way. Apart from Fyfe, I doubt any magnets are being moved off the board for Round 1 next year. 

Don't get me wrong, I was bitterly disappointed. And I would never use the term honorable loss. But to walk away and be able to think ""could we just have that season over again, please? we really don't have much else to add to our side except time and or experience"" is about the best one could feel after losing a home elimination final to a team that's never been there before.

Please, there is no such thing as 'should have' in this scenario. Because that exact same logic can be applied to every single team, and you can make the ladder go every way you want. Don't forget this 'should have finished 8th' team beat Hawthorn the last time they played at the same venue.

They finished where they did, as did 17 other clubs. You wanna change one, I can change all the others. 

And anyway, no draw that Adelaide could ever possibly get in any year, will ever be as soft as Collingwoods yearly draw where they have 17 out of 24 games at home. How does that factor into your equation regarding them?"

And that's exactly what you'll get out of this year. You guys are clearly on an upward trajectory and at the start of your window. You are outperforming given one of the youngest lists (even younger than GC) so that experience will only make you better. It's actually scary how well positioned you are.

There's a reason people talk about the game through the lens of Swallow and the Suns' first finals win, and not so much about Freo ""fumbling"" or ""choking"". This wasn't like Melbourne being overrun by St Kilda a month ago, or the laughing stock of Port when the Suns won their first ever game against them, or even the 2013 GF (sorry). You played a great game last week, but were pipped at the post by a team who were also playing out of their skin. Most know that it could have gone either way. Maybe it's another way of saying ""honourable loss"" but you guys didn't lose any respect.

I've seen finals losses crush a team's spirit, and I've seen finals losses galvanise teams to become something even greater. I've seen Hodge talk about how narrowly losing in 2012 spurred the Hawks on to win the next three. I feel you guys had a galvanising loss on the weekend.

On a personal note, I was one of the few Suns supporters at the game, and the mass of Freo supporters were super classy given the heartbreak of what they just witnessed. I've always liked you guys and look forward to you winning your first cup, which will probably be soon. Just as long as it isn't at the expense of the Suns :)

Obviously he’s not in peak shape but a torp that only goes a few metres more than drop punt is rarely worth the risk from full back or as a shot for goal.

Where it could be more used is as a zone bearing chaos ball inside 50.

Collingwood have tried a few inside 50 since the Adelaide home and away game where they decided to get more creative going inside 50. Pendles has done it about once a week. Schultz to Darcy Cameron last week worked beautifully.

I can see it becoming a weapon forward of centre."
